INTRODUCTORY NOTE Mucu of the life of Dante Alighieri is obscure, and the known facts are surrounded by a haze of legend and conjecture. He was born in Florence in 1265, of a family noble but not wealthy. His early education is a matter of inference, but we know that he learned the art of writing verse from the poets of France and Provence, and that after he reached manhood he devoted much time to study and became profoundly learned. As a young man he saw military service and shared in the recreations of his contemporaries; and he married some time before he was thirty-two. In Dante’s day politics in Florence were exciting and dangerous; and after a few years of participation in public affairs he was condemned to death by his political enemies in 1302. He saved himself by exile, and never returned to his native town. The rest of his life was mainly spent wandering about the north of Italy, in Verona, Bologna, Pisa, Lucca, and finally Ravenna, where he died in 1321. During the years of his exile he found generous patrons in men like the heads of the Scala family in Verona and Guido Novello da Polenta in Ravenna; and at Bologna and elsewhere he was welcomed as a teacher. In the early part of the century in which Dante was born, the literary language of Tuscany was still Latin, and not the least of his services to his country was his influence in finally establishing the dignity of Italian as a medium for great literature. He himself used Latin in at least three works: his lecture “De Aqua et Terra”; his “De Monarchia,” in which he expounded his political theory of the relation of the Empire and the Papacy; and his unfinished “De Vulgari Eloquentia,” containing his defense of the use of Italian. More important, however, were his two great works in the vernacular, the “Vita Nuova,” a series of poems with prose commentary, on his love for Beatrice, and the “Divina Commedia.” The Beatrice, real or ideal, who plays so important a part in the poetry of Dante, is stated by Boccaccio to have been the daughter of Folco Portinari, a rich Florentine, and wife of the banker Simone dei Bardi. With this actual person Dante’s acquaintance seems to have been of the slightest; but, after the fashion of the chivalric lovers of the day, he took her as the object of his ideal devotion. She became for him, especially after her death in 1290, the center of a mystical devotion of extraordinary intensity, and appears in his masterpiece as the personification of heavenly enlightenment. The “Divine Comedy” was entitled by Dante himself merely “Com3

4 INTRODUCTION media,” “meaning a poetic composition in a style intermediate between the sustained nobility of tragedy, and the popular tone of elegy.” The word had no dramatic implication at that time, though it did involve a happy ending. The poem is the narrative of a journey down through Hell, up the mountain of Purgatory, and through the revolving heavens into the presence of God. In this aspect it belongs to the two familiar medieval literary types of the Journey and the Vision. It is also an allegory, representing under the symbolism of the stages and experiences of the journey, the history of a human soul, painfully struggling from sin through purification to the Beatific Vision. Other schemes of interpretation have been worked out and were probably intended, for Dante granted the medieval demand for a threefold and even fourfold signification in this type of writing. But the “Divine Comedy” belongs to still other literary forms than those mentioned. Professor Grandgent has pointed out that it is also an encyclopedia, a poem in praise of Woman, and an autobiography. It contains much of what Dante knew of theology and philosophy, of astronomy and cosmography, and fragments of a number of other branches of learning, so that its encyclopedic character is obvious. In making it a monument to Beatrice, he surpassed infinitely all the poetry devoted to the praise of women in an age when the deification of women was the commonplace of poetry. And finally he made it an autobiography —not a narrative of the external events of his life, but of the agony of his soul. Thus, in an altogether unique way, Dante summarizes the literature, the philosophy, the science, and the religion of the Middle Ages. Through the intensity of his capacity for experience, the splendor of his power of expression, and the depth of his spiritual and philosophic insight, he at once sums up and transcends a whole era of human history.

THE DIVINE COMEDY INFERNO [HELL] CANTO I ARGUMENT.—The writer, having lost his way in a gloomy forest, and being hindered by certain wild beasts from ascending a mountain, is met by Virgil, who promises to show him the punishments of Hell, and afterward of Purgatory; and that he shall then be conducted by Beatrice into Paradise. He follows the Roman poet. N the midway! of this our mortal life, I found me in a gloomy wood, astray Gone from the path direct: and e’en to tell, It were no easy task, how savage wild That forest, how robust and rough its growth, Which to remember only, my dismay Renews, in bitterness not far from death. Yet, to discourse of what there good befel, All else will I relate discover'd there. How first I enter’d it I scarce can say, Such sleepy dulness in that instant weigh’d My senses down, when the true path I left; But when a mountain’s foot I reach’d, where closed The valley that had pierced my heart with dread, I look’d aloft, and saw his shoulders broad Already vested with that planet’s beam,” Who leads all wanderers safe through every way. Then was a little respite to the fear, That in my heart’s recesses deep had lain All of that night, so pitifully past: And as a man, with difficult short breath, Forespent with toiling, ’scaped from sea to shore, Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands 1*In the midway.” The era of the highest point of which is, in those well poem is intended by these words to be framed by nature, at their thirty-fifth fixed to the thirty-fifth year of the poet’s year. age, av. 1300.

My weary frame After short pause recomforted, again I journey’d on over that lonely steep, The hinder foot’ still firmer. Scarce the ascent Began, when, lo! a panther,’ nimble, light, And cover’d with a speckled skin, appear’d; Nor, when it saw me, vanish’d; rather strove To check my onward going; that oft-times, With purpose to retrace my steps, I turn’d. The hour was morning’s prime, and on his way Aloft the sun ascended with those stars,° That with him rose when Love Divine first moved Those its fair works: so that with joyous hope All things conspired to fill me, the gay skin Of that swift animal, the matin dawn, And the sweet season. Soon that joy was chased. And by new dread succeeded, when in view A lion came, ’gainst me as it appear’d, With his head held aloft and hunger-mad, That e’en the air was fear-struck. A she-wolf Was at his heels, who in her leanness seem’d Full of all wants, and many a land hath made Disconsolate ere now. She with such fear O’erwhelm’d me, at the sight of her appall’d, That of the height all hope I lost. As one, Who, with his gain elated, sees the time When all unawares is gone, he inwardly Mourns with heart-griping anguish; such was I, Haunted by that fell beast, never at peace, Who coming o’er against me, by degrees Impell’d me where the sun in silence rests. While to the lower space with backward step I fell, my ken discern’d the form of one Whose voice seem’d faint through long disuse of speech.

At Rome my life was past, Beneath the mild Augustus, in the time Of fabled deities and false.

But thou, say wherefore to such perils past Return’st thou? wherefore not this pleasant mount Ascendest, cause and source of all delight?” “And art thou then that Virgil, that well-spring, From which such copious floods of eloquence Have issued?” I with front abash’d replied. “Glory and light of all the tuneful train!

This beast, At whom thou criest, her way will suffer none To pass, and no less hinderance makes than death: So bad and so accursed in her kind, That never sated is her ravenous will, Still after food more craving than before.

CANTO II HELL 9 CANTO II AxcuMEent.—After the invocation, which poets are used to prefix to their works, he shows that, on a consideration of his own strength, he doubted whether it sufficed for the journey proposed to him, but that, being comforted by Virgil, he at last took courage, and followed him as his guide and master. OW was the day departing, and the air, Imbrown’d with shadows, from their toils released All animals on earth; and I alone Prepared myself the conflict to sustain, Both of sad pity, and that perilous road, Which my unerring memory shall retrace.

That from this terror thou mayst free thyself, I will instruct thee why I came, and what I heard in that same instant, when for thee Grief touch’d me first. I was among the tribe, Who rest suspended,? when a dame, so blest And lovely I besought her to command, Call’d me; her eyes were brighter than the star Of day; and she, with gentle voice and soft, Angelically tuned, her speech address’d: ‘O courteous shade of Mantua! thou whose fame Yet lives, and shall live long as nature lasts! A friend, not of my fortune but myself, On the wide desert in his road has met Hindrance so great, that he through fear has turn’d.

No need hast thou further to speak thy will: Yet tell the reason, why thou art not loth To leave that ample space, where to return Thou burnest, for this centre here beneath.’ “She then: ‘Since thou so deeply wouldst inquire, I will instruct thee briefly why no dread Hinders my entrance here. Those things alone Are to be fear’d whence evil may proceed; None else, for none are terrible beside. I am so framed by God, thanks to His gracel That any sufferance of your misery Touches me not, nor flame of that fierce fire Assails me.

Beatrice! why is not thy succour lent To him, who so much loved thee, as to leave For thy sake all the multitude admires?

As she will’d, Thus am I come: I saved thee from the beast, Who thy near way across the goodly mount Prevented. What is this comes o’er thee then? Why, why dost thou hang back? why in thy breast Harbour vile fear? why hast not courage there, And noble daring; since three maids,’ so blest, Thy safety plan, e’en in the court of Heaven; And so much certain good my words forebode?” As florets, by the frosty air of night Bent down and closed, when day has blanch’d their leaves, Rise all unfolded on their spiry stems; So was my fainting vigor new restored, And to my heart such kindly courage ran, That I as one undaunted soon replied: “O full of pity she, who undertook My succour! and thou kind, who didst perform So soon her true behest! With such desire Thou hast disposed me to renew my voyage, That my first purpose fully is resumed. Lead on: one only will is in us both. Thou art my guide, my master thou, and lord.” So spake I; and when he had onward moved, I enter'd on the deep and woody way. 7“Three maids.” The Divine Mercy, Lucia and Beatrice.

CANTO 11 HELL 13 CANTO III ARGUMENT.—Dante, following Virgil, comes to the gate of Hell; where, after having read the dreadful words that are written thereon, they both enter. Here, as he understands from Virgil, those were punished who had passed their time (for living it could not be called) in a state of apathy and indifference both to good and evil. Then, pursuing their way, they arrive at the river Acheron; and there find the old ferryman Charon, who takes the spirits over to the opposite shore; which, as soon as Dante reaches, he is seized with terror, and falls into a trance. “ HROUGH me you pass into the city of woe: Through me you pass into eternal pain: Through me among the people lost for aye. Justice the founder of my fabric moved: To rear me was the task of Power divine, Supremest Wisdom, and primeval Love.! Before me things create were none, save things Eternal, and eternal I endure. All hope abandon, ye who enter here.” Such characters, in color dim, I mark’d Over a portal’s lofty arch inscribed. Whereat I thus: “Master, these words import Hard meaning.” He as one prepared replied: “Here thou must all distrust behind thee leaves Here be vile fear extinguish’d. We are come Where I have told thee we shall see the souls To misery doom’d, who intellectual good Have lost.” And when his hand he had stretch’d forth To mine, with pleasant looks, whence I was cheer'd, Into that secret place he led me on. Here sighs, with lamentations and loud moans, Resounded through the air pierced by no star, That e’en I wept at entering. Various tongues, Horrible languages, outcries of woe, Accents of anger, voices deep and hoarse, With hands together smote that swell’d the sounds, Made up a tumult, that forever whirls Round through that air with solid darkness stain’d, Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies. I then, with horror yet encompast, cried: “O master! what is this I hear? what race Are these, who seem so overcome with woe?” 1 “Power,” “Wisdom,” “Love,” the three Persons of the Blessed Trinity.

14 THE DIVINE COMEDY CANTO III He thus to me: “This miserable fate Suffer the wretched souls of those, who lived Without or praise or blame, with that ill band Of angels mix’d, who nor rebellious proved, Nor yet were true to God, but for themselves Were only. From his bounds Heaven drove them forth Not to impair his lustre; nor the depth Of Hell receives them, lest the accursed tribe Should glory thence with exultation vain.” I then: “Master! what doth aggrieve them thus, That they lament so loud?” He straight replied: “That will I tell thee briefly. These of death No hope may entertain: and their blind life So meanly passes, that all other lots They envy. Fame of them the world hath none, Nor suffers; Mercy and Justice scorn them both. Speak not of them, but look, and pass them by.” And I, who straightway look’d, beheld a flag, Which whirling ran around so rapidly, That it no pause obtain’d: and following came Such a long train of spirits, I should ne'er Have thought that death so many had despoil’d. When some of these I recognized, I saw And knew the shade of him, who to base fear? Yielding, abjured his high estate. Forthwith I understood, for certain, this the tribe Of those ill spirits both to God displeasing And to His foes. These wretches, who ne’er lived, Went on in nakedness, and sorely stung By wasps and hornets, which bedew’d their cheeks With blood, that, mix’d with tears, dropp’d to their feet, And by disgustful worms was gather’d there. Then looking further onwards, I beheld 2This is commonly understood of Celestine V, who abdicated the papal power in 1294. Venturi mentions a work written by Innocenzio Barcellini, of the Celestine order, and printed at Milan in 1701, in which an attempt is made to put a different interpretation on this passage. Lombardi would apply it to some one of Dante's fellow-citizens, who, refusing, through avarice or want of spirit, to support the party of the Bianchi at Florence, had been the main occasion of the miseries that befell] them. But the testimony of Fazio degli Uberti, who lived so near the time of our author, seems almost decisive on this point. He expressly speaks of the Pope Celestine as being in Hell.

CANTO III HELL 15 A throng upon the shore of a great stream: Whereat I thus: “Sir! grant me now to know Whom here we view, and whence impell’d they seem So eager to pass o’er, as I discern Through the blear light?” He thus to me in few: “This shalt thou know, soon as our steps arrive Beside the woful tide of Acheron.” Then with eyes downward cast, and fill’d with shame, Fearing my words offensive to his ear, Till we had reach’d the river, I from speech Abstain’d. And lo! toward us in a bark Comes on an old man, hoary white with eld, Crying, “Woe to you, wicked spirits! hope not Ever to see the sky again. I come To take you to the other shore across, Into eternal darkness, there to dwell In fierce heat and in ice. And thou, who there Standest, live spirit! get thee hence, and leave These who are dead.” But soon as he beheld I left them not, “By other way,” said he, “By other haven shalt thou come to shore, Not by this passage; thee a nimbler boat Must carry.” Then to him thus spake my guide: “Charon! thyself torment not: so ‘tis will’d, Where will and power are one: ask thou no more.” Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks Of him, the boatman o’er the livid lake, Around whose eyes glared wheeling flames. Meanwhile Those spirits, faint and naked, color changed, And gnash’d their teeth, soon as the cruel words They heard. God and their parents they blasphemed, The human kind, the place, the time, and seed, That did engender them and give them birth, Then all together sorely wailing drew To the curst strand, that every man must pass Who fears not God. Charon, demoniac form, With eyes of burning coal, collects them all, Beckoning, and each, that lingers, with his oar Strikes. As fall off the light autumnal! leaves One still another following, till the bough

Hence ne’er hath past Good spirit. If of thee Charon complain, Now mayst thou know the import of his words.” This said, the gloomy region trembling shook So terribly, that yet with clammy dews Fear chills my brow. The sad earth gave a blast, That, lightening, shot forth a vermilion flame, Which all my senses conquer’d quite, and I Down dropp’d, as one with sudden slumber seized. CANTO IV ArcumENT.—The Poet, being roused by a clap of thunder, and following his guide onward, descends into Limbo, which is the first circle of Hell, where he finds the souls of those, who, although they have lived virtuously and have not to suffer for great sins, nevertheless, through lack of baptism, merit not the bliss of Paradise. Hence he is led on by Virgil to descend into the second circle. ROKE the deep slumber in my brain a crash Of heavy thunder, that I shook myself, As one by main force roused. Risen upright, My rested eyes I moved around, and search’d With fixed ken, to know what place it was Wherein I stood. For certain, on the brink I found me of the lamentable vale, The dread abyss, that joins a thundrous sound Of plaints innumerable. Dark and deep, 3“As a falcon at his call."

Let us on. Our length of way Urges to haste.” Onward, this said, he moved; And entering led me with him, on the bounds Of the first circle that surrounds the abyss. Here, as mine ear could note, no plaint was heard Except of sighs, that made the eternal air Tremble, not caused by tortures, but from grief Felt by those multitudes, many and vast, Of men, women, and infants. Then to me The gentle guide: “Inquirest thou not what spirits Are these which thou beholdest? Ere thou pass Farther, I would thou know, that these of sin Were blameless; and if aught they merited, It profits not, since baptism was not theirs, The portal’ to thy faith. If they before The Gospel lived, they served not God aright; And among such am I. For these defects, And for no other evil, we are lost; Only so far afflicted, that we live Desiring without hope.” Sore grief assail’d My heart at hearing this, for well I knew Suspended in that Limbo many a soul Of mighty worth. “O tell me, sire revered! Tell me, my master!” I began, through wish Of full assurance in that holy faith Which vanquishes all error; “say, did e’er Any, or through his own or other’s merit, 17 “Porta della fede.” This thority, as it would appear, of only two was an alteration made in the text by the manuscripts.

When thus my master kind began: “Mark him, Who in his right hand bears that falchion keen, The other three preceding, as their lord. 2 “Secret purport.” Lombardi well ob- probably, it docs not occur once throughserves that Dante seems to have been out the whole of this first part of the restrained by awe and reverence from poem uttering the name of Christ in this place 3“A puissant one.” Our Saviour. of torment; and that for the same cause,

CANTO V HELL 2I CANTO V AxcuMENT.—Coming into the second circle of Hell, Dante at the entrance beholds Minos the Infernal Judge, by whom he is admonished to beware how he enters those regions. Here he witnesses the punishment of carnal sinners, who are tossed about ceaselessly in the dark air by the most furious winds. Among these, he meets with Francesca of Rimini, through pity at whose sad tale he falls fainting to the ground. ROM the first circle I descended thus Down to the second, which, a lesser space Embracing, so much more of grief contains, Provoking bitter moans. There Minos stands, Grinning with ghastly feature: he, of all Who enter, strict examining the crimes, Gives sentence, and dismisses them beneath, According as he foldeth him around: For when before him comes the ill-fated soul, It all confesses; and that judge severe Of sins, considering what place in Hell Suits the transgression, with his tail so oft Himself encircles, as degrees beneath He dooms it to descend. Before him stand Always a numerous throng; and in his turn Each one to judgment passing, speaks, and hears His fate, thence downward to his dwelling hurl’d. “O thou! who to this residence of woe Approachest!” when he saw me coming, cried Minos, relinquishing his dread employ, “Look how thou enter here; beware in whom Thou place thy trust; let not the entrance broad Deceive thee to thy harm.” To him my guide: “Wherefore exclaimest? Hinder not his way By destiny appointed; so ’tis will’d, Where will and power are one. Ask thou no more.” Now ’gin the rueful wailings to be heard. Now am I come where many a plaining voice Smites on mine ear. Into a place I came Where light was silent all. Bellowing there groan’d A noise, as of a sea in tempest torn By warring winds. The stormy blast of Hell With restless fury drives the spirits on, Whirl’d round and dash’d amain with sore annoy.

THE DIVINE COMEDY CANTO V When they arrive before the ruinous sweep, There shrieks are heard, there lamentations, moans, And blasphemies ’gainst the good Power in Heaven. I understood, that to this torment sad The carnal sinners are condemn’d, in whom Reason by lust is sway’d. As, in large troops And multitudinous, when winter reigns, The starlings on their wings are borne abroad; So bears the tyrannous gust those evil souls. On this side and on that, above, below, It drives them: hope of rest to solace them Is none, nor e’en of milder pang. As cranes, Chanting their dolorous notes, traverse the sky, Stretch’d out in long array; so I beheld Spirits, who came loud wailing, hurried on By their dire doom. Then I: “Instructor! who Are these, by the black air so scourged?” “The first *Mong those, of whom thou question’st,” he replied, “O’er many tongues was empress. She in vice Of luxury was so shameless, that she made Liking be lawful by promulged decree, To clear the blame she had herself incurr’d. This is Semiramis, of whom ’tis writ, That she succeeded Ninus her espoused; And held the land, which now the Soldan rules. The next in amorous fury slew herself, And to Sichzus’ ashes broke her faith: Then follows Cleopatra, lustful queen.” There mark’d I Helen, for whose sake so long The time was fraught with evil; there the great Achilles, who with love fought to the end. Paris I saw, and Tristan; and beside, A thousand more he show’d me, and by name Pointed them out, whom love bereaved of life. When I had heard my sage instructor name Those dames and knights of antique days, o’erpower'd By pity, well-nigh in amaze my mind Was lost; and I began: “Bard! willingly I would address those two together coming, Which seem so light before the wind.” He thus:

HELL 23 “Note thou, when nearer they to us approach. Then by that love which carries them along, Entreat; and they will come.” Soon as the wind Sway’d them towards us, I thus framed my speech: “O wearied spirits! come, and hold discourse With us, if by none else restrain’d.” As doves By fond desire invited, on wide wings And firm, to their sweet nest returning home, Cleave the air, wafted by their will along; Thus issued, from that troop where Dido ranks, They, through the ill air speeding: with such force My cry prevail’d, by strong affection urged. “O gracious creature and benign! who go’st Visiting, through this element obscure, Us, who the world with bloody stain imbrued; If, for a friend, the King of all, we own'd, Our prayer to him should for thy peace arise, Since thou hast pity on our evil plight. Of whatsoe’er to hear or to discourse It pleases thee, that will we hear, of that Freely with thee discourse, while e’er the wind, As now, is mute. The land,' that gave me birth, Is situate on the coast, where Po descends To rest in ocean with his sequent streams. “Love, that in gentle heart is quickly learnt, Entangled him by that fair form, from me Ta’en in such cruel sort, as grieves me still: Love, that denial takes from none beloved, Caught me with pleasing him so passing well, That, as thou seest, he yet deserts me not. Love brought us to one death: Caina? waits The soul, who spilt our life.” Such were their words; At hearing which, downward I bent my looks, And held them there so long, that the bard cried: “What art thou pondering?” I in answer thus: “Alas! by what sweet thoughts, what fond desire Must they at length to that ill pass have reach’d!” Then turning, I to them my speech address’d, 1“The land.” Ravenna. 2“Caina.” The place to which murderers are doomed.

THE DIVINE COMEDY CANTO V And thus began: “Francesca!® your sad fate Even to tears my grief and pity moves. But tell me; in the time of your sweet sighs, By what, and how Love granted, that ye knew Your yet uncertain wishes?” She replied: “No greater grief than to remember days Of joy, when misery is at hand. That kens Thy learn’d instructor. Yet so eagerly If thou art bent to know the primal root, From whence our love gat being, I will do As one, who weeps and tells his tale. One day, For our delight we read of Lancelot,‘ How him love thrall’d. Alone we were, and no Suspicion near us. Oft-times by that reading Our eyes were drawn together, and the hue Fled from our alter’d cheek. But at one point Alone we fell. When of that smile we read, The wished smile so rapturously kiss’d By one so deep in love, then he, who ne’er From me shall separate, at once my lips All trembling kiss’d. The book and writer both Were love’s purveyors. In its leaves that day We read no more.” While thus one spirit spake, The other wail’d so sorely, that heart-struck I, through compassion fainting, seem’d not far From death, and like a corse fell to the ground. “Francesca.” Francesca, the daughter of Guido da Polenta, Lord of Ravenna, was given by her father in marriage to Gianciotto, son of Malatesta, Lord of Rimini, a man of extraordinary courage, but deformed in his person. His brother Paolo, who unhappily possessed those graces which the husband of Francesca wanted, engaged her affections; and being taken in adultery, they were both put to death by the enraged Gianciotto. *“Lancelot.” One of the Knights of the Round Table, and the lover of Ginevra, or Guinever, celebrated in romance. The incident alluded to seems to have made a strong impression on the imagination of Dante, who introduces it again, in the Paradise, Canto xvi.

CANTO VI HELL 25 CANTO VI ARGUMENT.—On his recovery, the Poet finds himself in the third circle, where the gluttonous are punished. Their torment is, to lie in the mire, under a continual and heavy storm of hail, snow, and discolored water; Cerberus, meanwhile barking over them with his threefold throat, and rending them piecemeal. One of these, who on earth was named Ciacco, foretells the divisions with which Florence is about to be distracted. Dante proposes a question to his guide, who solves it; and they proceed toward the fourth circle. Y sense reviving, that erewhile had droop’d With pity for the kindred shades, whence grief O’ercame me wholly, straight around I see New torments, new tormented souls, which way Soe’er I move, or turn, or bend my sight. In the third circle I arrive, of showers Ceaseless, accursed, heavy and cold, unchanged For ever, both in kind and in degree. Large hail, discolor’d water, sleety flaw Through the dun midnight air stream’d down amain: Stank all the land whereon that tempest fell. Cerberus, cruel monster, fierce and strange, Through his wide threefold throat, barks as a dog Over the multitude immersed beneath. His eyes glare crimson, black his unctuous beard, His belly large, and claw’d the hands, with which He tears the spirits, flays them, and their limbs Piecemeal disparts. Howling there spread, as curs, Under the rainy deluge, with one side The other screening, oft they roll them round, A wretched, godless crew. When that great worm! Descried us, savage Cerberus, he oped His jaws, and the fangs show’d us; not a limb Of him but trembled. Then my guide, his palms Expanding on the ground, thence fill’d with earth Raised them, and cast it in his ravenous maw. E’en as a dog, that yelling bays for food His keeper, when the morsel comes, lets fall His fury, bent alone with eager haste 1“When that great worm, descried us “The abhorred worm, ... he opened his jaws.” In Canto that boreth through the world.” xxxiv.

We, o’er the shades thrown prostrate by the brunt Of the heavy tempest passing, set our feet Upon their emptiness, that substance seem’d. They all along the earth extended lay, Save one, that sudden raised himself to sit, Soon as that way he saw us pass. “O thou!” He cried, “who through the infernal shades art led, Own, if again thou know’st me. Thou wast framed Or ere my frame was broken.” I replied: “The anguish thou endurest perchance so takes Thy form from my remembrance, that it seems As if I saw thee never. But inform Me who thou art, that in a place so sad Art set, and in such torment, that although Other be greater, none disgusteth more.” He thus in answer to my words rejoin’d: “Thy city, heap’d with envy to the brim, Aye, that the measure overflows its bounds, Held me in brighter days. Ye citizens Were wont to name me Ciacco.? For the sin Of gluttony, damned vice, beneath this rain, E’en as thou seest, I with fatigue am worn: Nor I sole spirit in this woe: all these Have by like crime incurr’d like punishment.” No more he said, and I my speech resumed: “Ciacco! thy dire affliction grieves me much, Even to tears. But tell me, if thou know’st, What shall at length befall the citizens Of the divided city;? whether any Just one inhabit there: and tell the cause, Whence jarring Discord hath assail’d it thus.” He then: “After long striving they will come 2“Ciacco."

Oh! tell me where They bide, and to their knowledge let me come. For I am prest with keen desire to hear If Heaven’s sweet cup, or poisonous drug of Hell, Be to their lip assign’d.” He answer’d straight: “These are yet blacker spirits. Various crimes Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss. If thou so far descendest, thou mayst see them. But to the pleasant world, when thou return’st, Of me make mention, I entreat thee, there.

THE DIVINE COMEDY CANTO VII This said, his fixed eyes he turn’d askance, A little eyed me, then bent down his head, And ’midst his blind companions with it fell. When thus my guide: “No more his bed he leaves, Ere the last angel-trumpet blow. The Power Adverse to these shall then in glory come, Each one forthwith to his sad tomb repair, Resume his fleshly vesture and his form, And hear the eternal doom re-echoing rend The vault.” So pass’d we through that mixture foul Of spirits and rain, with tardy steps; meanwhile Touching, though slightly, on the life to come. For thus I question’d: “Shall these tortures, Sir! When the great sentence passes, be increased, Or mitigated, or as now severe?” He then: “Consult thy knowledge; that decides, That, as each thing to more perfection grows, It feels more sensibly both good and pain. Though ne’er to true perfection may arrive This race accurst, yet nearer then, than now, They shall approach it.” Compassing that path, Circuitous we journey’d; and discourse, Much more than I relate, between us pass’d: Till at the point, whence the steps led below, Arrived, there Plutus, the great foe, we found, CANTO VII ARcuMENT.—In the present Canto, Dante describes his descent into the fourth circle, at the beyinning of which he secs Plutus stationed. Here one like doom awaits the prodigal and the avaricious; which is, to meet in direful conflict, rolling great weights against each other with mutual upbraidings. From hence Virgil takes occasion to show how vain the goods that are committed into the charge of Fortune; and this moves our author to inquire what being that Fortune is, of whom he speaks: which question being resolved, they go down into the fifth circle, where they find the wrathful and gloomy tormented in the Stygian lake. Having made a compass round great part of this lake, they come at last to the base of a lofty tower. “ @ H me! O Satan! Satan!”! loud exclaim’d Plutus, in accent hoarse of wild alarm: And the kind sage, whom no event surprised, To comfort me thus spake: “Let not thy fear Harm thee, for power in him, be sure, is none 2“Pape Satan, Pape Satan, aleppe;” words without meaning.

CANTO VII HELL To hinder down this rock thy safe descent.” Then to that swoln lip turning, “Peace!” he cried, “Curst wolf! thy fury inward on thyself Prey, and consume thee! Through the dark profound, Not without cause, he passes. So 'tis will’d On high, there where the great Archangel pour’d Heaven’s vengeance on the first adulterer proud.” As sails, full spread and bellying with the wind, Drop suddenly collapsed, if the mast split; So to the ground down dropp’d the cruel fiend. Thus we, descending to the fourth steep ledge, Gain'd on the dismal shore, that all the woe Hens in of all the universe. Ah me! Almighty Justice! in what store thou heap’st New pains, new troubles, as I here beheld. Wherefore doth fault of ours bring us to this? E’en as a billow, on Charybdis rising, Against encounter’d billow dashing breaks; Such is the dance this wretched race must lead, Whom more than elsewhere numerous here I found. From one side and the other, with loud voice, Both roll’d on weights, by main force of their breasts, Then smote together, and each one forthwith Roll'd them back voluble, turning again; Exclaiming these, “Why holdest thou so fast?” Those answering, “And why castest thou away?” So, still repeating their despiteful song, They to the opposite point, on either hand, Traversed the horrid circle; then arrived, Both turn’d them round, and through the middle space, Conflicting met again. At sight whereof I, stung with grief, thus spake: “O say, my guide! What race is this. Were these, whose heads are shorn, On our left hand, all separate to the Church?” He straight replied: “In their first life, these all In mind were so distorted, that they made, According to due measure, of their wealth No use. This clearly from their words collect, Which they howl forth, at each extremity Arriving of the circle, where their crime 29

THE DIVINE COMEDY CANTO VII Contrary in kind disparts them. To the Church Were separate those, that with no hairy cowls Are crowned, both Popes and Cardinals, o’er whom Avarice dominion absolute maintains.” I then: “‘’Mid such as these some needs must be, Whom J shall recognize, that with the blot Of these foul sins were stain’d.” He answering thus: “Vain thought conceivest thou. That ignoble life, Which made them vile before, now makes them dark, And to all knowledge indiscernible. For ever they shall meet in this rude shock: These from the tomb with clenched grasp shall rise, Those with close-shaven locks. That ill they gave, And ill they kept, hath of the beauteous world Deprived, and set them at this strife, which needs No labor’d phrase of mine to set it off. Now mayst thou see, my son! how brief, how vain, The goods committed into Fortune’s hands, For which the human race keep such a coill Not all the gold that is beneath the moon, Or ever hath been, of these toil-worn souls Might purchase rest for one.” I thus rejoin’d: “My guide! of these this also would I learn; This Fortune, that thou speak’st of, what it is, Whose talons grasp the blessings of the world.” He thus: “O beings blind! what ignorance Besets you! Now my judgment hear and mark. He, whose transcendent wisdom passes all, The heavens creating, gave them ruling powers To guide them; so that each part shines to each, Their light in equal distribution pour'd. By similar appointment he ordain’d, Over the world’s bright images to rule, Superintendence of a guiding hand And general minister, which, at due time, May change the empty vantages of life From race to race, from one to other’s blood, Beyond prevention of man’s wisest care: Wherefore one nation rises into sway, Another languishes, e’en as her will

CANTO VII HELL 31 Decrees, from us conceal’d, as in the grass The serpent train. Against her nought avails Your utmost wisdom. She with foresight plans, Judges, and carries on her reign, as theirs The other powers divine. Her changes know None intermission: by necessity She is made swift, so frequent come who claim Succession in her favors. This is she, So execrated e’en by those whose debt To her is rather praise: they wrongfully With blame requite her, and with evil word; But she is blessed, and for that recks not: Amidst the other primal beings glad Rolls on her sphere, and in her bliss exults. Now on our way pass we, to heavier woe Descending: for each star is falling now, That mounted at our entrance, and forbids Too long our tarrying.” We the circle cross’d To the next steep, arriving at a well, That boiling pours itself down to a foss Sluiced from its source. Far murkier was the wave Than sablest grain: and we in company Of the inky waters, journeying by their side, Enter’d, though by a different track, beneath. Into a lake, the Stygian named, expands The dismal! stream, when it hath reach’d the foot Of the gray wither’d cliffs. Intent I stood To gaze, and in the marish sunk descried A miry tribe, all naked, and with looks Betokening rage. They with their hands alone Struck not, but with the head, the breast, the feet, Cutting each other piecemeal with their fangs. The good instructor spake: “Now seest thou, son! The souls of those, whom anger overcame. This too for certain know, that underneath The water dwells a multitude, whose sighs Into these bubbles make the surface heave, As thine eye tells thee wheresoe’er it turn. Fix’d in the slime, they say: ‘Sad once were we, In the sweet air made gladsome by the sun,

32 THE DIVINE COMEDY CANTO VIII Carrying a foul and lazy mist within: Now in these murky settlings are we sad.’ Such dolorous strain they gurgle in their throats, But word distinct can utter none.” Our route Thus compass’d we, a segment widely stretch’d Between the dry embankment, and the core Of the loath’d pool, turning meanwhile our eyes Downward on those who gulp’d its muddy lees; Nor stopp’d, till to a tower’s low base we came. CANTO VIII ARrcuMENT.—A signal having been made from the tower, Phlegyas, the ferryman of the Jake, specdily crosses it, and conveys Virgil and Dante to the other side. On their passage, they meet with Filippo Argenti, whose fury and torment are described. They then arrive at the city of Dis, the entrance whereto is denied, and the portals closed against them by many Demons. Y theme pursuing, I relate, that ere We reach’d the lofty turret’s base, our eyes Its height ascended, where we mark’d uphung Two cressets, and another saw from far Return the signal, so remote, that scarce The eye could catch its beam. I, turning round To the deep source of knowledge, thus inquired: “Say what this means; and what, that other light In answer set: what agency doth this?” “There on the filthy waters,” he replied, “E’en now what next awaits us mayst thou see, If the marsh-gendered fog conceal it not.” Never was arrow from the cord dismiss’d, That ran its way so nimbly through the air, As a small bark, that through the waves I spied Toward us coming, under the sole sway Of one that ferried it, who cried aloud: “Art thou arrived, fell spirit?”—“Phlegyas, Phlegyas,' This time thou criest in vain,” my lord replied; “No longer shalt thou have us, but while o’er The slimy pool we pass.” As one who hears Of some great wrong he hath sustain’d, whereat ! Phlegyas, so incensed against Apollo by whose vengeance he was cast into for having violated his daughter Coronis, Tartarus. See Virgil, AEneas, 1. vi. 618. that he set fire to the temple of that deity,

CANTO VIII HELL Inly he pines: so Phlegyas inly pined In his fierce ire. My guide, descending, stepp’d Into the skiff, and bade me enter next, Close at his side; nor, till my entrance, seemn’d The vessel freighted. Soon as both embark’d, Cutting the waves, goes on the ancient prow, More deeply than with others it is wont. While we our course o’er the dead channel held, One drench’d in mire before me came, and said: “Who art thou, that thus comest ere thine hour?” I answer’d: “Though I come, I tarry not: But who art thou, that art become so foul?” “One, as thou seest, who mourn:” he straight replied. To which I thus: “In mourning and in woe, Curst spirit! tarry thou. I know thee well, E’en thus in filth disguised.” Then stretch’d he forth Hands to the bark; whereof my teacher sage Aware, thrusting him back: “Away! down there To the other dogs!” then, with his arms my neck Encircling, kiss’d my cheek, and spake: “O soul, Justly disdainful! blest was she in whom Thou wast conceived. He in the world was one For arrogance noted: to his memory No virtue lends its lustre; even so Here is his shadow furious. There above, How many now hold themselves mighty kings, Who here like swine shall wallow in the mire, Leaving behind them horrible dispraise.” I then: “Master! him fain would I behold Whelm’d in these dregs, before we quit the lake.” He thus: “Or ever to thy view the shore Be offer'd, satisfied shall be that wish, Which well deserves completion.” Scarce his words Were ended, when I saw the miry tribes Set on him with such violence, that yet For that render I thanks to God, and praise. “To Filippo Argenti!” ? cried they all: 33 2 Boccaccio tells us, “the was a man re- and the extreme waywardness and irascimarkable for the large proportions and bility of his temper."—‘Decameron,” G. extraordinary vigor of his bodily frame, ix.

But on mine ear Sudden a sound of lamentation smote, Whereat mine eye unbarr’d I sent abroad. And thus the good instructor: “Now, my son Draws near the city, that of Dis is named, With its grave denizens, a mighty throng.” I thus: “The minarets already, Sir! There, certes, in the valley I descry, Gleaming vermilion, as if they from fire Had issued.” He replied: “Eternal fire, That inward burns, shows them with ruddy flame Illumed; as in this nether Hell thou seest.” We came within the fosses deep, that moat This region comfortless. The walls appear’d As they were framed of iron. We had made Wide circuit, ere a place we reach’d, where loud The mariner cried vehement: “Go forth: The entrance is here.” Upon the gates I spied More than a thousand, who of old from Heaven Were shower’d. With ireful gestures, “Who is this,” They cried, “that, without death first felt, goes through The regions of the dead?” My sapient guide Made sign that he for secret parley wish’d; Whereat their angry scorn abating, thus They spake: “Come thou alone; and let him go, Who hath so hardily enter’d this realm. Alone return he by his witless way; If well he knew it, let him prove. For thee, Here shalt thou tarry, who through clime so dark Hast been his escort.” Now bethink thee, reader! What cheer was mine at sound of those curst words. I did believe I never should return. “O my loved guide! who more than seven times® 3“Seven times.” The commentators, Minos, Cerberus, Plutus, Phlegyas, and says Venturi, perplex themselves with the Filippo Argenti, as so many others, we inquiry what seven perils these were shall have the number; and if this be not from which Dante had been delivered by satisfactory, we may suppose a deterVirgil.

But not the less My fear was at his saying; sith I drew To import worse, perchance, than that he held, His mutilated speech. “Doth ever any Into this rueful concave’s extreme depth Descend, out of the first degree, whose pain Is deprivation merely of sweet hope?” Thus I inquiring. “Rarely,” he replicd, “It chances, that among us any makes This journey, which I wend.

In limb and motion feminine they seem’d; Around them greenest hydras twisting roll’d Their volumes; adders and cerastes crept Instead of hair, and their fierce temples bound. He, knowing well the miserable hags Who tend the queen of endless woe, thus spake: “Mark thou each dire Erynnis. To the left, This is Megara; on the right hand, she Who wails, Alecto; and Tistphone I’ th’ midst.” This said, in silence he remain’d. Their breast they each one clawing tore; themselves Smote with their palms, and such thrill clamour raised, That to the bard I clung, suspicion-bound. “Hasten Medusa: so to adamant Him shall we change;” all looking down exclaim’d: “E’en when by Theseus’ might assail’d, we took No ill revenge.” “Turn thyself round and keep Thy countenance hid; for if the Gorgon dire Be shown, and thou shouldst view it, thy return Upwards would be forever lost.” This said, Himself, my gentle master, turn’d me round; Nor trusted he my hands, but with his own He also hid me.

Landino supposes this hidden meaning to be that in the case of those vices which proceed from intemperance, reason, figured under the person of Virgil, with the ordinary grace of God, may be a sufficient safeguard; but that in the instance of more heinous crimes, such as those we shall hereafter see punished, a special grace, represented by the angel, is requisite for our defence.

And now there came o’er the perturbed waves Loud-crashing, terrible, a sound that made Either shore tremble, as if of a wind Impetuous, from conflicting vapors sprung, That ’gainst some forest driving all his might, Plucks off the branches, beats them down, and hurls Afar; then, onward passing, proudly sweeps His whirlwind rage, while beasts and shepherds fly. Mine eyes he loosed, and spake: “And now direct Thy visual nerve along that ancient foam, There, thickest where the smoke ascends.” As frogs Before their foe the serpent, through the wave Ply swiftly all, till at the ground each one Lies on a heap; more than a thousand spirits Destroy’d, so saw I fleeing before one Who pass’d with unwet feet the Stygian sound. He, from his face removing the gross air, Oft his left hand forth stretch’d, and seem’d alone By that annoyance wearied. I perceived That he was sent from Heaven; and to my guide Turn’d me, who signal made, that J should stand Quiet, and bend to him. Ah me! how full Of noble anger seem’d he. To the gate He came, and with his wand touch’d it, whereat Open without impediment it flew. “Outcasts of heaven! O abject race, scorn’d!” Began he, on the horrid grunsel standing, “Whence doth this wild excess of insolence Lodge in you? wherefore kick you ’gainst that will Ne’er frustrate of its end, and which so oft Hath laid on you enforcement of your pangs? What profits at the Fates to butt the horn? Your Cerberus,‘ if ye remember, hence Bears still, peel’d of their hair, his throat and maw.” “Your Cerberus.” Cerberus is feigned to have been dragged by Hercules, bound with a threefold chain, of which, says the angel, he still bears the marks. Lombardi blames the other interpreters for having supposed that the angel attributes this exploit to Hercules, a fabulous hero, rather than to our Saviour. It would seem as if the good father had forgotten that Cerberus is himself no Jess a creature of the imagination than the hero who encountered him.

Then we our steps Toward that territory moved, secure After the hallow’d words. We, unopposed, There enter’d; and, my mind eager to learn What state a fortress like to that might hold, I, soon as enter’d, throw mine eye around, And see, on every part, wide-stretching space, Replete with bitter pain and torment ill. As where Rhone stagnates on the plains of Arles, Or as at Pola,® near Quarnaro’s gulf, That closes Italy and laves her bounds, The place is all thick spread with sepulchres; So was it here, save what in horror here Excell’d: for ’midst the graves were scattered flames, Wherewith intensely all throughout they burn’d, That iron for no craft there hotter needs. Their lids all hung suspended; and beneath, From them forth issued lamentable moans, Such as the sad and tortured well might raise. I thus: “Master! say who are these, interr’d Within these vaults, of whom distinct we hear The dolorous sighs.” He answer thus return’d: “The arch-heretics are here, accompanied By every sect their followers; and much more Than thou believest, the tombs are freighted: like With like is buried; and the monuments Are different in degrees of heat.” This said, He to the right hand turning, on we pass’d Betwixt the afflicted and the ramparts high. 5“The plains of Arles.” In Provence. and 30, and by Fazio degli Uberti, DitThese sepulchres are mentioned in the tamondo, L. iv. cap. xxi.

Farinata predicts the Poet's exile from Florence; and shows him that the condemned have knowledge of future things, but are ignorant of what is at present passing, unless it be revealed by some newcomer from earth. OW by a secret pathway we proceed, Between the walls, that hem the region round, And the tormented souls: my master first, I close behind his steps. “Virtue supreme!” I thus began: “Who through these ample orbs In circuit lead’st me, even as thou will’st; Speak thou, and satisfy my wish. May those, Who lie within these sepulchres, be seen? Already all the lids are raised, and none O’er them keeps watch.” He thus in answer spake: “They shall be closed all, what-time they here From Josaphat! return’d shall come, and bring Their bodies, which above they now have left. The cemetery on this part obtain, With Epicurus, all his followers, Who with the body make the spirit die. Here therefore satisfaction shall be soon, Both to the question ask’d, and to the wish? Which thou conceal’st in silence.” I replied: “T keep not, guide beloved! from thee my heart Secreted, but to shun vain length of words; A lesson erewhile taught me by thyself.” “O Tuscan! thou, who through the city of fire Alive art passing, so discreet of speech: Here, please thee, stay awhile.

Meanwhile the other, great of soul, near whom I yet was station’d, changed not countenance stern, Nor moved the neck, nor bent his ribbed side. “And if,” continuing the first discourse, “They in this art,” he cried, “small skill have shown; That doth torment me more e’en than this bed.

Villani, lib. viii. .¢. xli,, “of a philosophical and elegant mind, if he had not been too delicate and fastidious.” Guido they soon Had in contempt.” Guido Cavalcanti, being more given to philosophy than poetry, was perhaps no great admirer of Virgil. 5“Not yet fifty times.” “Not fifty months shal! be passed, before thou shalt learn, by woeful experience, the difficulty of returning from banishment to thy Native city.” ®“Queen of this realm.” The moon, one of whose titles in heathen mythology was Proserpine, queen of the shades below. 10“The slaughter.” “By means of Farinata degli Uberti, the Guelft were conquered by the army of King Manfredi, near the river Arbia, with so great a slaughter, that those who escaped from that defeat took refuge, not in Florence, which city they considered as lost to them, but in Lucca.”—Macchiavelli, “Hist. of Flor.” b. ii. and G.

If right I hear, Ye scem to view beforehand that which time Leads with him, of the present uninform’d.” “We view, as one who hath an evil sight,” He answer’d, “plainly, objects far remote; So much of his large splendor yet imparts The Almighty Ruler: but when they approach, Or actually exist, our intellect Then wholly fails; nor of your human state, Except what others bring us, know we aught. Hence therefore mayst thou understand, that all Our knowledge in that instant shall expire, When on futurity the portals close.” Then conscious of my fault,'* and by remorse Smitten, I added thus: “Now shalt thou say To him there fallen, that his offspring still Is to the living join’d; and bid him know, That if from answer, silent, I abstain’d, 11“Such orisons.” This appears to allude to certain prayers which were offered up in the churches of Florence, for deliverance from the hostile attempts of the Uberti; or, it may be that the public councils being held in churches, the speeches delivered in them against the Uberti are termed “‘orisons,” or prayers. 12 “Singly there I stood.” Guido Novello assembled a council of the Ghibellini at Empoli; where it was agreed by all, that, in order to maintain the ascendancy of the Ghibelline party in Tuscany, it was necessary to destroy Florence, which could serve only (the people of that city being Guelfi) to enable the party attached to the church to recover its strength. This cruel sentence, passed upon so noble a city, met with no opposition from any of its citizens or friends, except Farinata degli Uberti, who openly and without reserve forbade the measure; affirming, that he had endured so many hardships, with no other view than that of being able to pass his days in his own country.

But I my steps toward the ancient bard Reverting, ruminated on the words Betokening me such ill. Ouward he moved, And thus, in going, question’d: “Whence the amaze That holds thy senses wrapt?” I satisfied The inquiry, and the sage enjoin’d me straight: “Let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard, To thee importing harm; and note thou this,” With his raised finger bidding me take heed, “When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam,'* Whose bright eye all surveys, she of thy life The future tenor will to thee unfold.” Forthwith he to the left hand turn’d his feet: We left the wall, and toward the middle space Went by a path that to a valley strikes, Which e’en thus high exhaled its noisome steam. 14 “Frederick.” The Emperor Frederick II., who died in 1250. See notes to Canto xiii. “The Lord Cardinal.” Ottaviano Ubaldini, a Florentine, made cardinal in 1245, and deceased about 1273. On account of his great influence, he was generally known by the appellation of “the Cardinal.” It is reported of him that he declared if there were any such thing as a human soul he had lost his for the Ghibellini. 16“Her gracious beam."

CANTO XI HELL 45 CANTO XI AgcuMENT.—Dante arrives at the verge of a rocky precipice which encloses the seventh circle, where he sces the sepulchre of Anastasius the Heretic; behind the lid of which pausing a little, to make himself capable by degrees of enduring the fetid smell that steamed upward from the abyss, he is instructed by Virgil concerning the manner in which the three following circles are disposed, and what description of sinners is punished in cach. He then inquires the reason why the carnal, the gluttonous, the avaricious and prodigal, the wrathful and gloomy, suffer not their punishments within the city of Dis. He next asks how the crime of usury is an offence against God; and at length the two Poets go toward the place from whence a passage leads down to the seventh circle. PON the utmost verge of a high bank, By craggy rocks environ’d round, we came. Where woes beneath, more cruel yet, were stow’d: And here, to shun the horrible excess Of fetid exhalation upward cast From the profound abyss, behind the lid Of a great monument we stood retired, Whereon this scroll I mark’d: “I have in charge Pope Anastasius,’ whom Photinus drew From the right path.” “Ere our descent, behoves We make delay, that somewhat first the sense, To the dire breath accustom’d, afterward Regard it not.” My master thus; to whom Answering I spake: “Some compensation find, That the time pass not wholly lost.” He then: “Lo! how my thoughts e’en to thy wishes tend. My son! within these rocks,” he thus began, “Are three close circles in gradation placed, As these which now thou leavest. Each one is full Of spirits accurst; but that the sight alone Hereafter may suffice thee, listen how And for what cause in durance they abide, “Of all malicious act abhorr’d in Heaven, The end is injury; and all such end Either by force or fraud works other’s woe.

To God, his neighbor, and himself, by man Force may be offer’d; to himself I say, And his possessions, as thou soon shalt hear At full. Death, violent death, and painful wounds Upon his neighbor he inflicts; and wastes, By devastation, pillage, and the flames, His substance. Slayers, and cach one that smites In malice, plunderers, and all robbers, hence The torment undergo of the first round, In different herds. Man can do violence To himself and his own blessings: and for this, He, in the second round must aye deplore With unavailing penitence his crime, Whoe’er deprives himself of life and light, In reckless lavishment his talent wastes, And sorrows there where he should dwell in joy. To God may force be offer’d, in the heart Denying and blaspheming His high power, And Nature with her kindly law contemning. And thence the inmost round marks with its seal Sodom, and Cahors, and all such as speak Contemptuously of the Godhead in their hearts. “Fraud, that in every conscience leaves a sting, May be by man employ’d on one, whose trust He wins, or on another, who withholds Strict confidence. Seems as the latter way Broke but the bond of love which Nature makes, Whence in the second circle have their nest, Dissimulation, witchcraft, flatteries, Theft, falsehood, simony, all who seduce To lust, or set their honesty at pawn, With such vile scum as these. The other way Forgets both Nature’s general love, and that Which thereto added afterward gives birth To special faith. Whence in the lesser circle,

And if it be not, wherefore in such guise Are they condemn’d?” He answer thus return’d: “Wherefore in dotage wanders thus thy mind, Not so accustom’d? or what other thoughts Possess it? Dwell not in thy memory The words, wherein thy ethic page? describes Three dispositions adverse to Heaven's will, Incontinence, malice, and mad brutishness, And how incontinence the least offends God, and least guilt incurs? If well thou note This judgment, and remember who they are, Without these walls to vain repentance doom'd, Thou shalt discern why they apart are placed From these fell spirits, and less wreakful pours Justice divine on them its vengeance down.” “O sun! who healest all imperfect sight, Thou so content’st me, when thou solvest my doubt, That ignorance not less than knowledge charms.

At these, when they strive to emerge from the blood, a troop of Centaurs, running along the side of the river, aim their arrows; and three of their band opposing our travellers at the foot of the steep, Virgil prevails so far that one consents to carry them both across the stream; and on their passage, Dante is informed by him of the course of the river, and of those that are punished therein.

CANTO XIII ARGUMENT.—Still in the seventh circle, Dante enters its second compartment, which contains both those who have done violence on their own persons and those who have violently consumed their goods; the first changed into rough and knotted trees whereon the harpies build their nests, the latter chased and torn by black female mastiffs. Among the former, Piero delle Vigne is one who tells him the cause of his having committed suicide, and moreover in what manner the souls are transformed into those trunks. Of the latter crew, he recognizes Lano, a Siennese, and Giacomo, a Paduan; and lastly, a Florentine, who had hung himself from his own roof, speaks to him of the calamities of his countrymen.

Thy hand might well have spared us, had we been The souls of serpents.” As a brand yet green, That burning at one end from the other sends A groaning sound, and hisses with the wind That forces out its way, so burst at once Forth from the broken splinter words and blood.

But tell me, who thou wast; That, for this wrong to do thee some amends, In the upper world (for thither to return Is granted him) thy fame he may revive.” “That pleasant word of thine,” the trunk replied, “Hath so inveigled me, that I from speech Cannot refrain, wherein if I indulge A little longer, in the snare detain’d, Count it not grievous.

He was cruelly condemned to lose his eyes. Driven to despair by his unmerited calamity he dashed out his brains against the walls of a church, in the year 1245.

The harlot, who ne’er turn’d her gloating eyes From Czsar’s household, common vice and pest Of courts, ’gainst me inflamed the minds of all; And to Augustus they so spread the flame, That my glad honours changed to bitter woes. My soul, disdainful and disgusted, sought Refuge in death from scorn, and I became, Just as I was, unjust toward myself. By the new roots, which fix this stem, I swear, That never faith I broke to my liege lord, Who merited such honour; and of you, If any to the world indeed return, Clear he from wrong my memory, that lies Yet prostrate under envy’s cruel blow.” First somewhat pausing, till the mournful words Were ended, then to me the bard began: “Lose not the time; but speak, and of him ask, If more thou wish to learn.” Whence I replied: “Question thou him again of whatsoe’er Will, as thou think’st, content me; for no power Have I to ask, such pity is at my heart.” He thus resumed: “So may he do for thee Freely what thou entreatest, as thou yet Be pleased, imprison’d spirit! to declare, How in these gnarled joints the soul is tied; And whether any ever from such frame Be loosen'd, if thou canst, that also tell.” Thereat the trunk breathed hard, and the wind soon Changed into sounds articulate like these: “Briefly ye shall be answer’d.

And lo! there came Two naked, torn with briers, in headlong flight, That they before them broke each fan o’ th’ wood. “Haste now,” the foremost cried, “now haste thee, death!” The other, as seem’d, impatient of delay, Exclaiming, “Lano!* not so bent for speed Thy sinews, in the lists of Toppo’s field.” And then, for that perchance no longer breath Sufficed him, of himself and of a bush One group he made. Behind them was the wood Full of black female mastiffs, gaunt and fleet, As greyhounds that have newly slipt the leash.

I slung the fatal noose* from my own roof.” CANTO XIV ARGUMENT.—They arrive at the beginning of the third of those compartments into which this seventh circle is divided. It is a plain of dry and hot sand, where three kinds of violence are punished; namely, against God, against Nature, and against Art; and those who have thus sinned, are tormented by flakes of fire, which are eternally showering down upon them. Among the violent against God is found Capaneus, whose blasphemies they hear. Next, turning to the left along the forest of self-slayers, and having journeyed a Jittle onward, they meet with a streamlet of blood that issues from the forest and traverses the sandy plain. Here Virgil speaks to our Poet of a huge ancient statue that stands within Mount Ida in Crete, from a fissure in which statue there is a dripping of tears, from which the said streamlet, together with the three other infernal rivers, are formed.

The mournful wood waves round Its garland on all sides, as round the wood Spreads the sad foss. There, on the very edge, Our steps we stay’d. It was an area wide Of arid sand and thick, resembling most The soil that erst by Cato’s foot was trod. Vengeance of heaven! Oh! how shouldst thou be fear’d By all, who read what here mine eyes beheld. Of naked spirits many a flock I saw, All weeping piteously, to different laws Subjected; for on the earth some lay supine, Some crouching close were seated, others paced Incessantly around; the latter tribe More numcrous, those fewer who beneath The torment lay, but louder in their grief. O’er all the sand fell slowly wafting down Dilated flakes of fire, as flakes of snow On Alpine summit, when the wind is hush’d. As, in the torrid Indian clime, the son Of Ammon saw, upon his warrior band Descending, solid flames, that to the ground Came down; whence he bethought him with his troop To trample on the soil; for easier thus The vapor was extinguish’d, while alone: So fell the eternal fiery flood, wherewith The marle glow’d underneath, as under stove The viands, doubly to augment the pain. Unceasing was the play of wretched hands, Now this, now that way glancing, to shake off The heat, still falling fresh. I thus began: “Instructor! thou who all things overcomest, Except the hardy demons that rush’d forth To stop our entrance at the gate, say who Is yon huge spirit, that, as seems, heeds not The burning, but lies writhen in proud scorn, As by the sultry tempest immatured?”

If Jove Weary his workman out, from whom in ire He snatch’d the lightnings, that at my last day Transfix'd me; if the rest he weary out, At their black smithy laboring by turns, In Mongibello, while he cries aloud, ‘Help, help, good Mulciber!’ as erst he cried In the Phlegrzan warfare; and the bolts Launch he, full aim’d at me, with all his might; He never should enjoy a sweet revenge.” Then thus my guide, in accent higher raised Than I before had heard him: “Capaneus! Thou art more punish’d, in that this thy pride Lives yet unquench’d: no torment, save thy rage, Were to thy fury pain proportion’d full.” Next turning round to me, with milder lip He spake: “This of the seven kings was one, Who girt the Theban walls with siege, and held, As still he seems to hold, God in disdain, And sets His high omnipotence at naught. But, as I told him, his despiteful mood Is ornament well suits the breast that wears it. Follow me now; and look thou set not yet Thy foot in the hot sand, but to the wood Keep ever close.” Silently on we pass’d To where there gushes from the forest’s bound A little brook, whose crimson’d wave yet lifts My hair with horror.

A mountain rises there, Call’d Ida, joyous once with leaves and streams, Deserted now like a forbidden thing. It was the spot which Rhea, Saturn’s spouse, Chose for the secret cradle of her son; And better to conceal him, drown’d in shouts His infant cries. Within the mount, upright An ancient form there stands, and huge, that turns His shoulders toward Damiata; and at Rome, As in his mirror, looks. Of finest gold His head is shaped, pure silver are the breast And arms, thence to the middle is of brass, And downward all beneath well-temper’d steel, Save the right foot of potter’s clay, on which Than on the other more erect he stands.

Wherefore, if aught of new to us appear, It needs not bring up wonder in thy looks.” Then I again inquired: ‘Where flow the streams Of Phlegethon and Lethe? for of one Thou tell’st not; and the other, of that shower, Thou say’st, is form’d.” He answer thus return’d: “Doubtless thy questions all well pleased I hear. Yet the red seething wave? might have resolved One thou proposest. Lethe thou shalt see, But not within this hollow, in the place Whither,* to lave themselves, the spirits go, Whose blame hath been by penitence removed.” He added: “Time is now we quit the wood. Look thou my steps pursue: the margins give Safe passage, unimpeded by the flames; For over them all vapor is extinct.” CANTO XV 61 ArGcuMENT.—Taking their way upon one of the mounds by which the streamlet, spoken of in the last Canto, was embanked, and having gone so far that they could no longer have discerned the forest if they had turned round to look for it, they meet a troop of spirits that come along the sand by the side of the pier. These are they who have done violence to Nature; and among them Dante distinguishes Brunetto Latini, who had been formerly his master; with whom, turning a litte backward, he holds a discourse which occupies the remainder of this Canto. 1A part of the Alps where the Brenta rises, swollen by melting snows.

Thus narrowly explored by all the tribe, I was agnized of one, who by the skirt Caught me, and cried, “What wonder have we here?” And I, when he to me outstretch’d his arm, Intently fix’d my ken on his parch’d looks, That, although smirch’d with fire, they hinder’d not But I remember’d him; and toward his face My hand inclining, answer’d: “Ser Brunetto!?

He complies and speaks with them. The two Poets then reach the place where the water descends, being the termination of this third compartment 1n the seventh circle; and here Virgil, having thrown down into the hollow a cord, wherewith Dante was girt, they behold at that signal a monstrous and horrible figure come swimming up to them. OW came I where the water’s din was heard As down it fell into the other round, Resounding like the hum of swarming bees: When forth together issued from a troop, That pass’d beneath the fierce tormenting storm, Three spirits, running swift. They toward us came, And each one cried aloud, “Oh! do thou stay, Whom, by the fashion of thy garb, we deem To be some inmate of our evil land.” Ah me! what wounds I mark’d upon their limbs, Recent and old, inflicted by the flames. E’en the remembrance of them grieves me yet. Attentive to their cry, my teacher paused, And turned to me his visage, and then spake: “Wait now: our courtesy these merit well: And were’t not for the nature of the place, Whence glide the fiery darts, I should have said, That haste had better suited thee than them.” They, when we stopp’d, resumed their ancient wail, And, soon as they had reach’d us, all the three Whirl’d round together in one restless wheel.

He was of the family of Ravignani, a branch of the Adimari. The Emperor Otho IV being at a festival in Florence, where Gualdrada was present, was struck with her beauty; and inquiring who she was, was answered by Bellincione, that she was the daughter of one who, if it was his Majesty's pleasure, would make her admit the honor of his salute. On overhearing this, she arose from her seat, and blushing, desired her father that he would not be so liberal in his offers. The Emperor was delighted by her resolute modesty, and calling to him Guido, one of his barons, gave her to him in marriage; at the same time raising him to the rank of a count, and bestowing on her the whole of Casentino, and a part of the territory of Romagna, as her portion. Two sons were the offspring of this union, Guglielmo and Ruggieri; the latter was father of Guidoguerra, who, at the head of four hundred Florentines of the Guelf party, was signally instrumental to the victory of Charles of Anjou at Benevento, over Manfredi, King of Naples, in 1265. One consequence of this was the expulsion of the Ghibellini and the re-establishment of the Guelfi at Florence. 2 Tegghiaio Aldobrandi endeavored to dissuade the Florentines from the attack which they meditated against the Siennese; the rejection of his counsel occasioned the defeat which the former sustained at Montaperto, and the consequent banishment of the Guelfi from Florence. 3 Giacopo Rusticucci, a Florentine, remarkable for his opulence and generosity of spirit.

Then to the right he turn’d, and from the brink Standing few paces distant, cast it down Into the deep abyss. “And somewhat strange,” Thus to myself I spake, “signal so strange Betokens, which my guide with earnest eye Thus follows.” He compares the fall of Phlegethon to that of the Montone (a river in Romagna) from the Apennines above the Abbey of St. Benedict. All the other streams that rise between the sources of the Po and the Montone, and fall from the left side of the Apennines, join the Po and accompany it to the sea. 7 There it loses the name of Acquacheta, and takes that of Montone. 8 Either because the abbey was capable of containing more than those who ocAh! what caution must men use cupied it, or because (says Landino) the lords of that territory had intended to build a castle near the water-fall, and to collect within its walls the population of the neighboring villages. 9"A cord.” It is believed that our poet in early life, had entered into the order of St. Francis. By observing the tules of that profession he had designed “to take the painted leopard” (that animal represented Pleasure) “with this cord.”

But silence here were vain; and by these notes, Which now I sing, reader, I swear to thee, So may they favor find to latest times! That through the gross and murky air I spied A shape come swimming up, that might have quell’d The stoutest heart with wonder; in such guise As one returns, who hath been down to loose An anchor grappled fast against some rock, Or to aught else that in the salt wave lies, Who, upward springing, close draws in his feet. CANTO XVII ARcuMENT.—The monster Geryon is described; to whom while Virgil is speaking in order that he may carry them both down to the next circle, Dante, by permission, goes further along the edge of the void, to descry the third species of sinners contained in this compartment, namely, those who have done violence to Art; and then returning to his master, they both descend, seated on the back of Geryon. *°“wr O! the fell monster’ with the deadly sting, Who passes mountains, breaks through fenced walls And firm embattled spears, and with his filth Taints all the world.” Thus me my guide address’d, And beckon’d him, that he should come to shore, Near to the stony causeway’s utmost edge. Forthwith that image vile of Fraud appear’d, His head and upper part exposed on land, But laid not on the shore his bestial train. His face the semblance of a just man’s wore, So kind and gracious was its outward cheer; The rest was serpent all: two shaggy claws ! “The fell monster.” Fraud.

Colours variegated more Nor Turks nor Tartars e’er on cloth of state With interchangeable embroidery wove, Nor spread Arachne o’er her curious loom. As oft-times a light skiff, moor’d to the shore, Stands part in water, part upon the land; Or, as where dwells the greedy German boor, The beaver settles, watching for his prey; So on the rim, that fenced the sand with rock, Sat perch’d the fiend of evil. In the void Glancing, his tail upturn’d its venomous fork, With sting like scorpion’s arm’d. Then thus my guide, “Now need our way must turn few steps apart, Far as to that ill beast, who couches there.” Thereat, toward the right our downward course We shaped, and, better to escape the flame And burning marle, ten paces on the verge Proceeded. Soon as we to him arrive, A little farther on mine eye beholds A tribe of spirits, seated on the sand Near to the void. Forthwith my master spake: “That to the full thy knowledge may extend Of all this round contains, go now, and mark The mien these wear: but hold not lony discourse. Till thou returnest, I with him meantime Will parley, that to us he may vouchsafe The aid of his strong shoulders.” Thus alone, Yet forward on the extremity I paced Of that seventh circle, where the mournful tribe Were seated. At the eyes forth gush’d their pangs, Against the vapors and the torrid soil Alternately their shifting hands they plied. Thus use the dogs in summer still to ply Their jaws and feet by turns, when bitten sore By gnats, or flies, or gadflies swarming round. Noting the visages of some, who lay Beneath the pelting of that dolorous fire, One of them all I knew not; but perceived,

CANTO XVII HELL 71 That pendent from his neck each bore a pouch? With colours and with emblems various mark’d, On which it seem’d as if their eye did feed. And when, amongst them, looking round I came, A yellow purse® I saw with azure wrought, That wore a lion’s countenance and port. Then, still my sight pursuing its career, Another‘ I beheld, than blood more red, A goose display of whiter wing than curd. And one, who bore a fat and azure swine® Pictured on his white scrip, address’d me thus: “What dost thou in this deep? Go now and know, Since yet thou livest, that my neighbor here Vitaliano® on my left shall sit. A Paduan with these Florentines am I. Oft-times they thunder in mine ears, exclaiming, ‘Oh! haste that noble knight,’ he who the pouch With the three goats will bring.’” This said, he writhed The mouth, and loll’d the tongue out, like an ox That licks his nostrils. I, lest longer stay He ill might brook, who bade me stay not long, Backward my steps from those sad spirits turn’d. My guide already seated on the haunch Of the fierce animal I found; and thus He me encouraged. “Be thou stout: be bold. Down such a steep flight must we now descend. Mount thou before: for, that no power the tail May have to harm thee, I will be i’ th’ midst.” As one, who hath an ague fit so near, His nails already are turn’d blue, and he Quivers all o’er, if he but eye the shade; Such was my cheer at hearing of his words.

Think on the unusual burden thou sustain’st.” As a small vessel, backening out from land, Her station quits; so thence the monster loosed, And, when he felt himself at large, turn’d round There, where the breast had been, his forked tail. Thus, like an eel, outstretch’d at length he steer’d, Gathering the air up with retractile claws. Not greater was the dread, when Phaéton The reins let drop at random, whence high heaven, Whereof signs yet appear, was wrapt in flames; Nor when ill-fated Icarus perceived, By liquefaction of the scalded wax, The trusted pennons loosen’d from his loins, His sire exclaiming loud, “Ill way thou keep’st,” Than was my dread, when round me on each part The air I view’d, and other object none Save the fell beast. He, slowly sailing, wheels His downward motion, unobserved of me, But that the wind, arising to my face, Breathes on me from below. Now on our right T heard the cataract beneath us leap With hideous crash; whence bending down to explore, New terror I conceived at the steep plunge; For flames I saw, and wailings smote mine ear: So that, all trembling, close I crouch’d my limbs, And then distinguish’d, unperceived before, By the dread torments that on every side Drew nearer, how our downward course we wound. As falcon, that hath long been on the wing, But lure nor bird hath seen, while in despair The falconer cries, “Ah me! thou stoop’st to earth,” Wearied descends, whence nimbly he arose

CANTO XVIII ARGcUMENT.—The Poet describes the situation and form of the eighth circle, divided into ten gulfs, which contain as many different descriptions of fraudulent sinners; but in the present Canto he treats only of two sorts: the first is of those who, either for their own pleasure, or for that of another, have seduced any woman from her duty; and these are scourged of demons in the first gulf: the other sort is of flatterers, who in the second gulf are condemned to remain immersed in filth. HERE is a place within the depths of Hell Call’d Malebolge, all of rock dark-stain’d With hue ferruginous, e’en as the steep That round it circling winds. Right in the midst Of that abominable region yawns A spacious gulf profound, whereof the frame Due time shall tell. The circle, that remains, Throughout its round, between the gulf and base Of the high craggy banks, successive forms Ten bastions, in its hollow bottom raised. As where, to guard the walls, full many a foss Begirds some stately castle, sure defence Affording to the space within; so here Were model’d these: and as like fortresses, E’en from their threshold to the brink without, Are flank’d with bridges; from the rock’s low base Thus flinty paths advanced, that ’cross the moles And dykes struck onward far as to the gulf, That in one bound collected cuts them off. Such was the place, wherein we found ourselves From Geryon’s back dislodged. The bard to left Held on his way, and I behind him moved. On our right hand new misery I saw, New pains, new executioners of wrath, That swarming peopled the first chasm. Below Were naked sinners. Hitherward they came,

None for the second waited, nor the third. Meantime, as on I pass’d, one met my sight, Whom soon as view’d, “Of him,” cried I, “not yet Mine eye hath had his fill.” 1 therefore stay’d My feet to scan him, and the teacher kind Paused with me, and consented I should walk Backward a space; and the tormented spirit, Who thought to hide him, bent his visage down. But it avail’d him naught; for I exclaim’d: “Thou who dost cast thine eye upon the ground, Unless thy features do belie thee much, Venedico? art thou. But what brings thee Into this bitter seasoning?” He replied: “Unwillingly I answer to thy words. But thy clear speech, that to my mind recalls The world I once inhabited, constrains me.

My gentle guide, By me unquestion’d, thus his speech resumed: “Behold that lofty shade, who this way tends, And seems too woe-begone to drop a tear. How yet the regal aspect he retains! Jason is he, whose skill and prowess won The ram from Colchis. To the Lemnian isle His passage thither led him, when those bold And pitiless women had slain all their males.

Upon the banks a scurf, From the foul steam condensed, encrusting hung, That held sharp combat with the sight and smell. So hollow is the depth, that from no part, Save on the summit of the rocky span, Could I distinguish aught.

There beneath Searching with eye inquisitive, I mark’d One with his head so grimed, ’t were hard to deem If he were clerk or Jayman.

Therefore than all the rest I scan thee more.” Then beating on his brain, these words he spake: “Me thus low down my flatteries have sunk, Wherewith I ne’er enough could glut my tongue.” My leader thus: “A little further stretch Thy face, that thou the visage well mayst note Of that besotted, sluttish courtesan, Who there doth rend her with defiled nails, Now crouching down, now risen on her feet.

These are fixed with the head downward in certain apertures, so that no more of them than the legs appears without, and on the soles of their feet are seen burning flames. Dante is taken down by his guide into the bottom of the gulf; and there finds Pope Nicholas V, whose evil deeds, together with those of other pontiffs, are bitterly reprehended. Virgil then carries him up again to the arch, which affords them a passage over the following gulf.

CANTO XX ARGUMENT.—The Poet relates the punishment of such as presumed, while living, to predict future events. It is to have their faces reversed and set the contrary way on their limbs, so that, being deprived of the power to see before them, they are constrained ever to walk backward. Among these Virgil points out to him Amphiaraiis, Tiresias, Aruns, and Manto (from the mention of whom he takes occasion to speak of the origin of Mantua), together with several others, who had practised the arts of divination and astrology. ND now the verse proceeds to torments new, Fit argument of this the twentieth strain Of the first song, whose awful theme records The spirits whelm’d in woe. Earnest I look’d Into the depth, that open’d to my view, Moisten’d with tears of anguish, and beheld A tribe, that came along the hollow vale, In silence weeping: such their step as walk Quires, chanting solemn litanies, on earth. As on them more direct mine eye descends, Each wonderously seem’d to be reversed At the neck-bone, so that the countenance Was from the reins averted; and because None might before him look, they were compell’d To advance with backward gait. Thus one perhaps Hath been by force of palsy clean transposed, But I ne’er saw it nor believe it so. Now, reader! think within thyself, so God Fruit of thy reading give thee! how I long Could keep my visage dry, when I beheld Near me our form distorted in such guise, That on the hinder parts fallen from the face The tears down-streaming roll’d.

And as one thought bursts from another forth, So afterward from that another sprang, Which added doubly to my former fear. For thus I reason’d: “These through us have been So foil’d, with loss and mockery so complete, As needs must sting them sore.

Down from the jutting beach Supine he cast him to that pendent rock, Which closes on one part the other chasm. Never ran water with such hurrying pace Adown the tube to turn a land-mill’s wheel, When nearest it approaches to the spokes, As then along that edge my master ran, Carrying me in his bosom, as a child, Not a companion. Scarcely had his feet Reach’d to the lowest of the bed beneath, When over us the steep they reach’d: but fear In him was none; for that high Providence, Which placed them ministers of the fifth foss, Power of departing thence took from them all.

Perchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish.” Whereat my leader, turning, me bespake: “Pause, and then onward at their pace proceed.” I staid, and saw two spirits in whose look Impatient eagerness of mind was mark’d To overtake me; but the load they bare And narrow path retarded their approach. Soon as arrived, they with an eye askance Perused me, but spake not: then turning, each To other thus conferring said: “This one Seems, by the action of his throat, alive; And, be they dead, what privilege allows They walk unmantled by the cumbrous stole?” Then thus to me: “Tuscan, who visitest The college of the mourning hypocrites, Disdain not to instruct us who thou art.” “By Arno’s pleasant stream,” I thus replied, “In the great city I was bred and grew, And wear the body I have ever worn. 2 They wore unusually large cowls. high treason by wrapping them up in 3The Emperor Frederick IH is said to lead and casting them into a furnace. have punished those who were guilty of

Catalano de’ Malavolti, the other M. Loderingo di Liandolo; one an adherent of the Guelf, the other of the Ghibelline party. It is to be remarked, that the Joyous Friars were called Knights of St. Mary, and became knights on taking that habit: their robes were white, the mantle sable, and the arms a white field and red cross with two stars: their office was to defend widows and orphans, they were to act as mediators; they had internal regulations, like other religious bodies. The above-mentioned M. Loderingo was the founder of that order. But it was not long before they too well deserved the appellation given them, and were found to be more bent on enjoying themselves than on any other object. These two friars were called in by the Florentines, and had a residence assigned them in the palace belonging to the people, over against the Abbey. Such was the dependence placed on the character of their order, it was expected they would be impartial, and would save the commonwealth any unnecessary expense; instead of which, though inclined to opposite parties, they secretly and hypocritically concurred in promoting their own advantage rather than the public good.”"—G,.

N the year’s early nonage,' when the sun Tempers his tresses in Aquarius’ urn, And now toward equal day the nights recede; Whenas the rime upon the earth puts on Her dazzling sister’s image, but not long Her milder sway endures; then riseth up The village hind, whom fails his wintry store, And looking out beholds the plain around All whiten’d; whence impatiently he smites His thighs, and to his hut returning in, There paces to and fro, wailing his lot, As a discomfited and helpless man; Then comes he forth again, and feels new hope Spring in his bosom, finding e’en thus soon The world hath changed its countenance, grasps his crook, And forth to pasture drives his little flock: So me my guide dishearten’d, when I saw His troubled forehead; and so speedily That ill was cured; for at the fallen bridge Arriving, toward me with a look as sweet, He turn’d him back, as that I first beheld At the steep mountain’s foot.

At length the point from whence the utmost stone Juts down, we reach’d; soon as to that arrived, So was the breath exhausted from my lungs I could no further, but did seat me there. “Now needs thy best of man;” so spake my guide: “For not on downy plumes, nor under shade Of canopy reposing, fame is won; Without which whosoe’r consumes his days, Leaveth such vestige of himself on earth, As smoke in air or foam upon the wave. Thou therefore rise: vanquish thy weariness By the mind’s effort, in each struggle form’d To vanquish, if she suffer not the weight Of her corporeal frame to crush her down. A longer ladder yet remains to scale. From these to have escaped sufficeth not, If well thou note me, profit by my words.” I straightway rose, and show’d myself less spent Than I in truth did feel me. “On,” I cried, “For I am stout and fearless.” Up the rock Our way we held, more rugged than before, Narrower, and steeper far to climb. From talk I ceased not, as we journey’d, so to seem Least faint; whereat a voice from the other foss Did issue forth, for utterance suited ill. Though on the arch that crosses there I stood, What were the words I knew not, but who spake Seem’d moved in anger. Down I stoop’d to look; But my quick eye might reach not to the depth For shrouding darkness; wherefore thus I spake: “To the next circle, teacher, bend thy steps,

To fair request Silent performance maketh best return.” We from the bridge’s head descended, where To the eighth mound it joins; and then, the chasm Opening to view, I saw a crowd within Of serpents terrible, so strange of shape And hideous, that remembrance in my veins Yet shrinks the vital current. Of her sands Let Libya vaunt no more: if Jaculus, Pareas and Chelyder be her brood, Cenchris and Amphisbzna, plagues so dire Or in such numbers swarming ne’er she show’d, Not with all Ethiopia, and whate’er Above the Erythrzan sea is spawn’d. Amid this dread exuberance of woe Ran naked spirits wing’d with horrid fear, Nor hope had they of crevice where to hide, Or heliotrope to charm them out of view. With serpents were their hands behind them bound, Which through their reins infix’d the tail and head, Twisted in folds before. And lo! on one Near to our side, darted an adder up, And, where the neck is on the shoulders tied, Transpierced him. Far more quickly than e’er pen Wrote O or I, he kindled, burn’d, and changed To ashes all, pour’d out upon the earth. When there dissolved he lay, the dust again Uproll’d spontaneous, and the self-same form Instant resumed. So mighty sages tell, The Arabian Phenix, when five hundred years Have well-nigh circled, dies, and springs forthwith Renascent: blade nor herb throughout his life He tastes, but tears of frankincense alone And odorous amomum: swaths of nard And myrrh his funeral shroud.

Oh! how severe God’s judgment, that deals out Such blows in stormy vengeance. Who he was, My teacher next inquired; and thus in few He answer’d: “Vanni Fucci? am I call’d, Not long since rained down from Tuscany To this dire gullet. Me the bestial life And not the human pleased, mule that I was, Who in Pistoia found my worthy den.” I then to Virgil: “Bid him stir not hence; And ask what crime did thrust him thither: once A man I knew him, choleric and bloody.” The sinner heard and feign’d not, but toward me His mind directing and his face, wherein Was dismal shame depictured, thus he spake: “It grieves me more to have been caught by thee In this sad plight, which thou beholdest, than When I was taken from the other life. I have no power permitted to deny What thou inquirest. I am doom’d thus low To dwell, for that the sacristy by me Was rifled of its goodly ornaments, And with the guilt another falsely charged. But that thou mayst not joy to see me thus, So as thou e’er shalt ’scape this darksome realm, Open thine ears and hear what I forebode.

Our Poet then meets with the spirits of three of his countrymen, two cf whom undergo a marvelous transformation in his presence. HEN he had spoke, the sinner raised his hands’ Pointed in mockery and cried: “Take them, God! T level them at thee.” From that day forth The serpents were my friends; for round his neck One of them rolling twisted, as it said, “Be silent, tongue!” Another, to his arms Upgliding, tied them, riveting itself So close, it took from them the power to move. Pistoia! ah, Pistoia! why dost doubt To turn thee into ashes, cumbering earth No longer, since in evil act so far Thou hast outdone thy seed? I did not mark, Through all the gloomy circles of the abyss, Spirit, that swell’d so proudly ’gainst his God; 5 Alluding to the victory obtained by the Marquis Morello Malaspina of Valdimagra, who put himself at the head of the Neri, and defeated their opponents the Bianchi, in the Campo Piceno near Pistoia, soon after the occurrence related in the preceding note on v. 142. Currado Mafaspina is introduced in the eighth Canto of the Purgatory; where it appears, that although on the present occasion they espoused contrary sides, most important favors were nevertheless conferred by that family on our Poet, at a subsequent period of his exile, in 1307. “The practice of thrusting out the thumb between the first and second fingers, to express the feelings of insult and contempt, has prevailed very generally among the nations of Europe, and for many ages had been denominated ‘making the fig,’ or described at least by some equivalent expression.”—Douce's “T!ustrations of Shakespeare,” vol. i. p. 492, ed. 1807.

CANTO XXV HELL 103 Not him,? who headlong fell from Thebes. He fled, Nor utter'd more; and after him there came A Centaur full of fury, shouting, “Where, Where is the caitiff?” On Maremma’s marsh*® Swarm not the serpent tribe, as on his haunch They swarm’d, to where the human face begins. Behind his head, upon the shoulders, lay With open wings a dragon, breathing fire On whomsoe’er he met. To me my guide: “Cacus is this, who underneath the rock Of Aventine spread oft a lake of blood. He, from his brethren parted, here must tread A different journey, for his fraudful theft Of the great herd that near him stall’d; whence found His felon deeds their end, beneath the mace Of stout Alcides, that perchance laid on A hundred blows, and not the tenth was felt.” While yet he spake, the Centaur sped away: And under us three spirits came, of whom Nor I nor he was ware, till they exclaim’d, “Say who are ye!” We then brake off discourse, Intent on these alone. I knew them not: But, as it chanceth oft, befell that one Had need to name another. “Where,” said he, “Doth Cianfa‘ lurk?” I, for a sign my guide Should stand attentive, placed against my lips The finger lifted. If, O reader! now Thou be not apt to credit what I tell, No marvel; for myself do scarce allow The witness of mine eyes. But as I look’d Toward them, lo! a serpent with six feet Springs forth on one, and fastens full upon him: His midmost grasp’d the belly, a forefoot Seized on each arm (while deep in either cheek He flesh’d his fangs); the hinder on the thighs Were spread, ’twixt which the tail inserted curl’d Upon the reins behind.

104 THE DIVINE COMEDY CANTO XXV The hideous monster intertwined his own. Then, as they both had been of burning wax, Each melted into other, mingling hues, That which was either now was seen no more. Thus up the shrinking paper, ere it burns, A brown tint glides, not turning yet to black, And the clean white expires. The other two Look’d on exclaiming, “Ah! how dost thou change, Agnello!® See! Thou art nor double now, Nor only one.” The two heads now became One, and two figures blended in one form Appear’d, where both were lost. Of the four lengths Two arms were made: the belly and the chest, The thighs and legs, into such members changed As never eye hath seen. Of former shape All trace was vanish’d. Two, yet neither, seem'd That image miscreate, and so pass’d on With tardy steps. As underneath the scourge Of the fierce dog-star that lays bare the fields, Shifting from brake to brake the lizard seems A flash of lightning, if he thwart the road; So toward the entrails of the other two Approaching seem’d an adder all on fire, As the dark pepper-grain livid and swart. In that part, whence our life is nourish’d first, Once he transpierced; then down before him fell Stretch’d out. The pierced spirit look’d on him, But spake not; yea, stood motionless and yawn’d, As if by sleep or feverous fit assail’d. He eyed the serpent, and the serpent him. One from the wound, the other from the mouth Breathed a thick smoke, whose vapory columns join’d. Lucan in mute attention now may hear, Nor thy disastrous fate, Sabellus, tell, Nor thine, Nasidius.

CANTO XXV HELL 105 Two natures thus transmuted did he sing, Wherein both shapes were ready to assume The other’s substance. They in mutual guise So answer’d that the serpent split his train Divided to a fork, and the pierced spirit Drew close his steps together, legs and thighs Compacted, that no sign of juncture soon Was visible: the tail, disparted, took The figure which the spirit lost; its skin Softening, his indurated to a rind. The shoulders next I mark’d, that entering join’d The monster’s arm-pits, whose two shorter feet So lengthen’d, as the others dwindling shrunk. The feet behind then twisting up became That part that man conceals, which in the wretch Was cleft in twain. While both the shadowy smoke With a new color veils, and generates The excrescent pile on one, peeling it off From the other body, lo! upon his feet One upright rose, and prone the other fell. Nor yet their glaring and malignant lamps Were shifted, though each feature changed beneath. Of him who stood erect, the mounting face Retreated toward the temples, and what there Superfluous matter came, shot out in ears From the smooth cheeks; the rest, not backward dragg’d, Of its excess did shape the nose; and swell’d Into due size protuberant the lips. He, on the earth who lay, meanwhile extends His sharpen’d visage, and draws down the ears Into the head, as doth the slug his horns. His tongue, continuous before and apt For utterance, severs; and the other’s fork Closing unites. That done, the smoke was laid. The soul, transform’d into the brute, glides off, Hissing along the vale, and after him The other talking sputters; but soon turn’d His new-grown shoulders on him, and in few Thus to another spake: “Along this path Crawling, as I have done, speed Buoso now ”

Yet ’scaped they not so covertly, but well I mark’d Sciancato: he alone it was Of the three first that came, who changed not: tho’ The other’s fate, Gaville! still dost rue. CANTO XXVI AxcuMENT.—Remounting by the steps, down which they have descended to the seventh gulf, they go forward to the arch that stretches over the eighth, and from thence behold numberless flames wherein are punished the evil counsellors, each fame containing a sinner, save one, in which were Diomede and Ulysses, the latter of whom relates the manner of his death. LORENCE, exult! for thou so mightily Hast thriven, that o’er land and sea thy wings Thou beatest, and thy name spreads over hell. Among the plunderers, such the three I found Thy citizens; whence shame to me thy son, And no proud honour to thyself redounds. But if our minds, when dreaming near the dawn, Are of the truth presageful, thou ere long Shalt feel what Prato' (not to say the rest) Would fain might come upon thee; and that chance Were in good time, if it befell thee now. Would so it were, since it must needs befall! For as time wears me, I shall grieve the more. We from the depth departed; and my guide Remounting scaled the flinty steps, which late We downward traced, and drew me up the steep. Pursuing thus our solitary way '“Shalt feel what Prato.” The Poet prognosticates the calamities which were soon to befall his native city, and which, he says, even her nearest neighbor, Prato, would wish her. The calamities more particularly pointed at are said to be the fall of a wooden bridge over the Arno, in May, 1304, where a large multitude were assembled to witness a representation of hell and the infernal torments, in consequence of which accident many lives were lost; and a conflagration, that in the following month destroyed more than 1,700 houses.

Then sorrow seized me, which e’en now revives, As my thought turns again to what I saw, And, more than I am wont, I rein and curb The powers of nature in me, lest they run Where Virtue guides not; that, if aught of good My gentle star or something better gave me, Tenvy not myself the precious boon. As in that season, when the sun least veils His face that lightens all, what time the fly Gives way to the shrill gnat, the peasant then, Upon some cliff reclined, beneath him sees Fire-flies innumerous spangling o’er the vale, Vineyard or tilth, where his day-labor lies; With flames so numberless throughout its space Shone the eighth chasm, apparent, when the depth Was to my view exposed. As he, whose wrongs The bears avenged, as its departure saw Elijah’s chariot, when the steeds erect Raised their steep flight for heaven; his eyes meanwhile, Straining pursued them, till the flame alone, Upsoaring like a misty speck, he kenn’d: E’en thus along the gulf moves every flame, A sinner so enfolded close in each, That none exhibits token of the theft. Upon the bridge I forward bent to look And grasp'd a flinty mass, or else had fallen, Though push’d not from the height. The guide, who mark’d How I did gaze attentive, thus began: “Within these ardours are the spirits; each Swathed in confining fire.” “Master! thy word,” I answer’d, “hath assured me; yet I deem’d Already of the truth, already wish’d To ask thee who is in yon fire, that comes So parted at the summit, as it seem’d Ascending from that funeral pile? where lay The Theban brothers.” He replied: “Within, 2 The flame is said to have divided the conscious of the enmity that actuated bodies of Eteocles and Polynices, as if them while living.

And there is rued the stratagem that Troy Of her Palladium spoil’d.”—“If they have power Of utterance from within these sparks,” said I, “O master! think my prayer a thousand-fold In repetition urged, that thou vouchsafe To pause till here the horned flame arrive. See, how toward it with desires I bend.” He thus: “Thy prayer is worthy of much praise, And I accept it therefore; but do thou Thy tongue refrain: to question them be mine; For I divine thy wish; and they perchance, For they were Greeks,‘ might shun discourse with thee.” When there the flame had come, where time and place Seem’d fitting to my guide, he thus began: “O ye, who dwell two spirits in one fire! If, living, I of you did merit aught, Whate’er the measure were of that desert, When in the world my lofty strain I pour'd, Move ye not on, till one of you unfold In what clime death o’ertook him self-destroy’d.” Of the old flame forthwith the greater horn Began to roll, murmuring, as a fire That labors with the wind, then to and fro Wagging the top, as a tongue uttering sounds, Threw out its voice, and spake: “When I escaped From Circe, who beyond a circling year Had held me near Caieta by her charms, Ere thus #neas yet had named the shore; Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence 3 The wooden horse that caused 7Eneas where his descendants founded Rome. ‘ quit Troy and seek his fortune in Italy, 4Perhaps implying arrogance.

Forth I sail’d Into the deep illimitable main, With but one bark, and the small faithful band That yet cleaved to me. As Iberia far, Far as Marocco, either shore I saw, And the Sardinian and each isle beside Which round that ocean bathes. Tardy with age Were I and my companions, when we came To the strait pass,® where Hercules ordain'd The boundaries not to be o’erstepp’d by man. The walls of Seville to my right I left, On the other hand already Ceuta past. ‘O brothers!’ I began, ‘who to the west Through perils without number now have reach’d; To this the short remaining watch, that yet Our senses have to wake, refuse not proof Of the unpeopled world, following the track Of Phoebus. Call to mind from whence ye sprang: Ye were not form’d to live the life of brutes, But virtue to pursue and knowledge high.’ With these few words | sharpen’d for the voyage The mind of my associates, that I then Could scarcely have withheld them.

Thrice it whirl’d her round With all the waves; the fourth time lifted up The poop, and sank the prow: so fate decreed: And over us the booming billow closed.” 7 CANTO XXVII ARGUMENT.—The Poet, treating of the same punishment as in the last Canto, relates that he turned toward a flame in which was the Count Guido da Montefeltro, whose inquiries respecting the state of Romagna he answers; and Guido is thereby induced to declare who he is, and why condemned to that torment. OW upward rose the flame, and still’d its light To speak no more, and now pass'd on with leave From the mild poet gain’d; when following came Another, from whose top a sound confused, Forth issuing, drew our eyes that way to look. As the Sicilian bull,' that rightfully His cries first echoed who had shaped its mould, Did so rebellow, with the voice of him Tormented, that the brazen monster seem’d Pierced through with pain; thus, while no way they found, Nor avenue immediate through the flame, Into its language turn’d the dismal words: But soon as they had won their passage forth, Up from the point, which vibrating obey’d Their motion at the tongue, these sounds were heard: “O thou! to whom I now direct my voice, That lately didst exclaim in Lombard phrase, ‘Depart thou; I solicit thee no more;’ Though somewhat tardy I perchance arrive, Let it not irk thee here to pause awhile, T™“Closed.” Venturi refers to Pliny and Solinus for the opinion that Ulysses was the founder of Lisbon, from whence he thinks it was easy for the fancy of a poet to send him on yet further enterprises. The story (which it is not unlikely that our author borrowed from some legend of the Middle Ages) may have taken its fise partly from the obscure oracle returned by the ghost of Tiresias to Ulysses (eleventh book of the Odyssey), and partly from the fate which there was reason to suppose had befallen some adventurous explorers of the Atlanuc Ocean. The engine of torture invented by Perillus, for the tyrant Phalaris.

The name of Polenta was derived from a castle so called in the neighborhood of Brittonoro. Cervia is a small maritime city, about fifteen miles to the south of Ravenna. Guido was the son of Ostasio da Polenta, and made himself master of Ravenna in 1265. In 1322 he was deprived of his sovereignty, and died at Bologna in 1323. This last and most munificent patron of Dante is enumerated among the poets of his time. 4 The territory of Forli, the inhabitants of which, in 1282, were enabled, by the stratagem of Guido da Montefeltro, the governor, to defeat the French army by which it had been besieged. See G. VilJani, Jib. vii. c. Ixxxi. The Poet informs Guido, its former ruler, that it is now in the possession of Sinibaldo Ordolafh, whom he designates by his coat-of-arms, a lion vert. 5 Malatesta and Malatestino his son, lords of Rimini, called from their ferocity, the mastiffs of Verrucchio, which was the name of their castle.

He blamed the Pope, cardinals, and other prelates of the holy Church, for not observing their duty, nor leading the angelic life, and afhrmed that he ought to be pope. He was followed by more than three thousand men and women, who lived promiscuously on the mountains together, like beasts, and, when they wanted provisions, supplied themselves by depredation and rapine. After two years, many were struck with compunction at the dissolute life they led, and his sect was much diminished; and, through failure of food and the severity of the snows, he was taken by the people of Novara, and burnt, with Margarita, his companion, and many others, whom he had seduced. 7 “Medicina.” A place in the territory of Bologna.

Mosca degli Uberti, or de’ Lamberti, persuaded them to resolve on the assassination of Buondelmonte, exclaiming to them, “the thing once done, there is an end.” This counsel and its effects were the source of many terrible calamities to the State of Florence. “This murder,” says G.

Two of them, namely, Grifolino of Arezzo, and Capocchio of Siena, are introduced speaking. O were mine eyes inebriate with the view Of the vast multitude, whom various wounds Disfigured, that they long’d to stay and weep. But Virgil roused me: “What yet gazest on?

Know, if thou wouldst number them, That two and twenty miles the valley winds Its circuit, and already is the moon Beneath our fect: the time permitted now Is short; and more, not seen, remains to see.” “If thou,” I straight replied, “hadst weigh’d the cause, For which I look’d, thou hadst perchance excused The tarrying still.” My leader part pursued His way, the while I follow’d, answering him, And adding thus: “Within that cave I deem, Whereon so fixedly I held my ken, There is a spirit dwells, one of my blood, Wailing the crime that costs him now so dear.” Then spake my master: “Let thy soul no more Afflict itself for him.

Step by step We journey’d on, in silence looking round, And listening those diseased, who strove in vain To lift their forms. Then two I mark’d, that sat Propt ’gainst each other, as two brazen pans Set to retain the heat. From head to foot, A tetter bark’d them round. Nor saw I e’er Groom currying so fast, for whom his lord Impatient waited, or himself perchance Tired with long watching, as of these each one Plied quickly his keen nails, through furiousness Of ne’er abated pruriency. The crust Came drawn from underneath, in flakes, like scales Scraped from the bream, or fish of broader mail. “O thou! who with thy fingers rendest off Thy coat of proof,” thus spake my guide to one, “And sometimes makest tearing pincers of them, Tell me if any born of Latian land Be among these within: so may thy nails Serve thee for everlasting to this toil.” “Both are of Latium,” weeping he replied, “Whom tortured thus thou seest: but who art thou That hast inquired of us?” To whom my guide: “One that descend with this man, who yet lives, From rock to rock, and show him Hell’s abyss.” Then started they asunder, and each turn’d Trembling toward us, with the rest, whose ear Those words redounding struck.

A little more, And I do quarrel with thee.” I perceived How angrily he spake, and toward him turn’d With shame so poignant, as remember'd yet Confounds me. As a man that dreams of harm Befallen him, dreaming wishes it a dream, And that which is, desires as if it were not; Such then was I, who, wanting power to speak, Wish'd to excuse myself, and all the while Excused me, though unweeting that I did.

Nimrod is this, Through whose ill counsel in the world no more One tongue prevails. But pass we on, nor waste Our words; for so each language is to him, As his to others, understood by none.” Then to the leftward turning sped we forth, And at a sling’s throw found another shade Far fiercer and more huge.

In the former, called Caina, Dante finds Camiccione de’ Pazzi, who gives him an account of other sinners who are there punished; and in the next, named Antenora, he hears in like manner from Bocca degli Abbati who his fellow-sufferers are. OULD I command rough rhymes and hoarse, to suit That hole of sorrow o’er which every rock His firm abutment rears, then might the vein Of fancy rise full springing: but not mine Such measurcs, and with faltering awe I touch The mighty theme; for to describe the depth Of all the universe, is no emprise To jest with, and demands a tongue not used To infant babbling. But let them assist My song, the tuneful maidens, by whose aid Amphion wall’d in Thebes; so with the truth My speech shall best accord.

A space I look’d around, then at my feet Saw two so strictly join’d, that of their head The very hairs were mingled. “Tell me ye, Whose bosoms thus together press,” said I, “Who are ye?” At that sound their necks they bent; And when their looks were lifted up to me, Straightway their eyes, before all moist within, Distill’d upon their lips, and the frost bound The tears betwixt those orbs, and held them there. Plank unto plank hath never cramp closed up So stoutly. Whence, like two enraged goats, They clash’d together: them such fury seized.

He next discourses of the third round, called Ptolomea, wherein those are punished who have betrayed others under the semblance of kindness; and among these he finds the Friar Alberigo de’ Manfredi, who tells him of one whose soul was already tormented in that place, though his body appeared still ts be alive upon the earth, being yielded up to the governance of a fiend.

With lean brachs Inquisitive and keen, before him ranged ———_ franchi, Sismondi, Gualandi, and other Ghibelline houses. The Count Ugolino, to effect his purpose, united with the archbishop and his party, and having betrayed Nino, his sister’s son, they contrived that he and his followers should either be driven out of Pisa, or their persons seized. Nino hearing this, and not seeing any means of defending himself, retired to Calci, his castle, and formed an alliance with the Florentines and the people of Lucca, against the Pisans. The count, before Nino was gone, in order to cover his treachery, when everything was settled for his expulsion, quitted Pisa, and repaired to a manor of his called Settimo; whence, as soon as he was informed of Nino's departure, he returned to Pisa with great rejoicing and festivity, and was elevated to the supreme power with every demonstration of triumph and honor. But his gteatness was not of long continuance. It pleased the Almighty that a total reverse of fortune should ensue, as a punishment for his acts of treachery and guilt; for he was said to have poisoned the Count Anselmo da Capraia, his sister’s son, on account of the envy and fear excited in his mind by the high esteem in which the gracious manners of Anselmo were held by the Pisans. The power of the Guelfi being so much diminished, the archbishop devised means to betray the Count Ugolino, and caused him to be suddenly attacked in his palace by the fury of the people, whom he had exasperated, by telling them that Ugolino had betrayed Pisa, and given up their castles to the citizens of Florence and of Lucca. He was immediately compelled to surrender; his bastard son and his grandson fell in the assault; and two of his sons, with their two sons also, were conveyed to prison. . . . In the following March, the Pisans, who had imprisoned the Count Ugolino, with two of his sons and two of his grandchildren, the offspring of his son the Count Guelfo, in a tower on the Piazza of the Anziani, caused the tower to be locked, the key thrown into the Arno, and all food to be withheld from them. In a few days they died of hunger; but the Count first with loud cries declared his penitence, and yet neither priest nor friar was allowed to shrive him. All the five, when dead, were dragged out of the prison, and meanly interred; and from thenceforward the tower was called the Tower of Famine, and so shall ever be.” G. Villani, lib. vii. 2The mountain S. Giuliano between Pisa and Lucca.

I wept not: so all stone I felt within. They wept: and one, my little Anselm, cried, ‘Thou lookest so! Father, what ails thee?’ Yet I shed no tear, nor answer’d all that day Nor the next night, until another sun Came out upon the world. When a faint beam Had to our doleful prison made its way, And in four countenances I descried The image of my own, on either hand Through agony I bit; and they, who thought I did it through desire of feeding, rose O’ the sudden, and cried, ‘Father, we should grieve Far less if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gavest These weeds of miserable flesh we wear; And do thou strip them off from us again.’ Then, not to make them sadder, I kept down My spirit in stillness. That day and the next We all were silent. Ah, obdurate earth! Why open’dst not upon us?

Hence, adds Landino, it is said proverbially of one who has been stabbed, that he had had some of the friar Alberigo's fruit. 5“Ptolomea.” This circle is named Ptolomea from Ptolemy the son of Abubus, by whom Simon and his sons were murdered, at a great banquet he had made for them.

I was not dead nor living. Think thyself, If quick conception work in thee at all, How I did feel. That emperor, who sways The realm of sorrow, at mid breast from the ice Stood forth; and I in stature am more like A giant, than the giants are his arms. Mark now how great that whole must be, which suits With such a part. If he were beautiful As he is hideous now, and yet did dare To scowl upon his Maker, well from him May all our misery flow. Oh what a sight! How passing strange it seem’d, when I did spy Upon his head three faces: one in front Of hue vermilion, the other two with this Midway each shoulder join’d and at the crest; The right ’twixt wan and yellow seem’d; the left To look on, such as come from whence old Nile Stoops to the lowlands. Under each shot forth Two mighty wings, enormous as became A bird so vast. Sails never such I saw Outstretch’d on the wide sea.

I raised mine eyes, Believing that I Lucifer should see Where he was lately left, but saw him now With legs held upward. Let the grosser sort, Who see not what the point was I had past, Bethink them if sore toil oppress’d me then. “Arise,” my master cried, “upon thy feet.

He maintains that by Brutus and Cassius are not meant the individuals known by those names, but any who put a lawful monarch to death. Yet if Casar was such, the conspirators might be regarded as deserving of their doom. If Dante, however, believed Brutus to have been actuated by evil motives in putting Czsar to death, the excellence of the patriot’s character in other respects would only have aggravated his guilt in that particular, 2 The Poct uses the Hebrew manner of computing the day, according to which the third hour answers to our twelve o'clock at noon.

We must retreat to rereward; for that way The champain to its low extreme declines.” The dawn had chased the matin hour of prime, Which fled before it, so that from afar I spied the trembling of the ocean stream. We traversed the deserted plain, as one Who, wander’d from his track, thinks every step Trodden in vain till he regain the path. When we had come, where yet the tender dew Strove with the sun, and in a place where fresh The wind breathed o’er it, while it slowly dried; Both hands extended on the watery grass My master placed, in graceful act and kind.

Lo! how straight up to Heaven he holds them rear'd, Winnowing the air with those eternal plumes, That not like mortal hairs fall off or change.” As more and more toward us came, more bright Appear’d the bird of God, nor could the eye Endure his splendor near: I mine bent down. He drove ashore in a small bark so swift And light, that in its course no wave it drank. The heavenly steersman at the prow was seen, Visibly written Blessed in his looks. Within a hundred spirits and more there sat. “In Exitu‘ Israel de Egypto,” All with one voice together sang, with what In the remainder of that hymn is writ. Then soon as with the sign of holy cross He bless’d them, they at once leap’d out on land: He, swiftly as he came, return’d.

Then one I saw darting before the rest With such fond ardour to embrace me, I To do the like was moved. O shadows vain! Except in outward semblance: thrice my hands I clasp’d behind it, they as oft return’d Empty into my breast again. Surprise I need must think was painted in my looks, For that the shadow smiled and backward drew. To follow it I hasten’d, but with voice Of sweetness it enjoin’d me to desist. Then who it was I knew, and pray’d of it, To talk with me it would a little pause. It answer’d: “Thee as in my mortal frame I loved, so loosed from it I love thee still, And therefore pause: but why walkest thou here?” “Not without purpose once more to return, Thou find’st me, my Casella,> where I am, Journeying this way;” I said: “but how of thee Hath so much time been lost?” He answer’d straight: “No outrage hath been done to me, if he,® Who when and whom he chooses takes, hath oft Denied me passage here; since of just will His will he makes.

My gentle guide, And all who came with him, so well were pleased, That seem’d naught else might in their thoughts have room. Fast fix’d in mute attention to his notes We stood, when lo! that old man venerable Exclaiming, “How is this, ye tardy spirits? What negligence detains you loitering here? Run to the mountain to cast off those scales, That from your eyes the sight of God conceal.” As a wild flock of pigeons, to their food Collected, blade or tares, without their pride Accustom’d, and in still and quiet sort, If aught alarm them, suddenly desert Their meal, assail’d by more important care; So I that new-come troop beheld, the song Deserting, hasten to the mountain’s side, As one who goes, yet, where he tends, knows not. Nor with less hurried step did we depart. 8“The shore.” Ostia.

CANTO III PURGATORY 153 CANTO III ArcumMent.—Our Poet, perceiving no shadow except that cast by his own body, is fearful that Virgil has deserted him; but he is freed from that error, and both arrive together at the foot of the mountain; on finding it too steep to climb, they inquire the way from a troop of spirits that are coming toward them, and are by them shown which is the easiest ascent. Manfredi, King of Naples, who is one of these spirits, bids Dante inform his daughter Costanza, Queen of Arragon, of the manner in which he had died. HEM sudden flight had scatter’d o’er the plain, Turn’d toward the mountain, whither reason’s voice Drives us: I, to my faithful company Adhering, left it not. For how, of him Deprived, might I have sped? or who, beside, Would o’er the mountainous tract have led my steps? He, with the bitter pang of self-remorse, Seem’d smitten. O clear conscience, and upright! How doth a little failing wound thee sore. Soon as his feet desisted (slackening pace) From haste, that mars all decency of act, My mind, that in itself before was wrapt, Its thought expanded, as with joy restored; And full against the steep ascent I set My face, where highest to Heaven its top o’erflows. The sun, that flared behind, with ruddy beam Before my form was broken; for in me His rays resistance met. I turn’d aside With fear of being left, when I beheld Only before myself the ground obscured. When thus my solace, turning him around, Bespake me kindly: “Why distrustest thou? Believest not I am with thee, thy sure guide? It now is evening there, where buried lies The body in which I cast a shade, removed To Naples' from Brundusium’s wall.

Meanwhile we had arrived Far as the mountain’s foot, and there the rock Found of so steep ascent, that nimblest steps To climb it had been vain. The most remote, Most wild, untrodden path, in all the tract *Twixt Lerice and Turbia,? were to this A ladder easy and open of access. “Who knows on which hand now the steep declines?” My master said, and paused; “‘so that he may Ascend, who journeys without aid of wing?” And while, with looks directed to the ground, The meaning of the pathway he explored, And I gazed upward round the stony height; On the left hand appear’d to us a troop Of spirits, that toward us moved their steps; Yet moving seem’d not, they so slow approach’d. I thus my guide address’d: “Upraise thine eyes: Lo! that way some, of whom thou mayst obtain Counsel, if of thyself thou find’st it not.” Straightway he Jook’d, and with free speech replied: “Let us tend thither: they but softly come. And thou be firm in hope, my son beloved.” Now was that crowd from us distant as far, (When we some thousand steps, I say, had past,) As at a throw the nervous arm could fling; 2“Twixt Lerice and Turbia.” At that republic; the former on the east, the time the two extremities of the Genoese latter on the west.

CANTO Il PURGATORY When all drew backward on the massy crags Of the steep bank, and firmly stood unmoved, As one, who walks in doubt, might stand to look. “O spirits perfect! O already chosen!” Virgil to them began: “by that blest peace, Which, as I deem, is for you all prepared, Instruct us where the mountain low declines, So that attempt to mount it be not vain. For who knows most, him loss of time most grieves.” As sheep, that step from forth their fold, by one, Or pairs, or three at once; meanwhile the rest Stand fearfully, bending the eye and nose To ground, and what the foremost does, that do The others, gathering round her if she stops, Simple and quiet, nor the cause discern; So saw I moving to advance the first, Who of that fortunate crew were at the head, Of modest mien, and graceful in their gait. When they before me had beheld the light From my right side fall broken on the ground, So that the shadow reach’d the cave; they stopp’d, And somewhat back retired: the same did all Who follow’d, though unweeting of the cause. “Unask’d of you, yet freely I confess, This is a human body which ye see. That the sun’s light is broken on the ground, Marvel not: but believe, that not without Virtue derived from Heaven, we to climb Over this wall aspire.” So them bespake My master; and that virtuous tribe rejoin’d: “Turn, and before you there the entrance lies;” Making a signal to us with bent hands. Then of them one began. “Whoe'er thou art, Who journey’st thus this way, thy visage turn; Think if me elsewhere thou hast ever seen.” I toward him turn’d, and with fix’d eye beheld. Comely and fair, and gentle of aspect He seem’d, but on one brow a gash was mark’d. When humbly I disclaim’d to have beheld Him ever: ‘Now behold!” he said, and show’d 155

He fell in the battle with Charles of Anjou in 1265, alluded to in Canto xxviii of Hell, ver. 13, or rather in that of Benevento. The successes of Charles were so rapidly followed up, that our author, exact as he generally is, might not have thought it necessary to distinguish them in point of time. “Dying excommunicated, King Charles did not allow of his being buried in sacred ground, but he was interred near the bridge of Benevento; and on his grave there was cast a stone by every one of the army, whence there was formed a great mound of stones. But some have said, that afterward, by command of the Pope, the Bishop of Cosenza took up his body and sent it out of the kingdom, because it was the land of the Church; and that it was buried by the river Verde, on the borders of the kingdom and of Campagna.” 4 See Paradise, Canto iii. 121. 5 Costanza, the daughter of Manfredi, and wife of Peter III, King of Arragon, by whom she was mother to Frederick, King of Sicily, and James, King of Arragon.

There seating themselves, and turning to the east, Dante wonders at seeing the sun on their left, the cause of which 1s explained to him by Virgil; and while they continue their discourse, a voice addresses them, at which they turn, and find several spirits behind the rock, and among the rest one named Belacqua, who had been known to our Poet on earth, and who tells that he is doomed to linger there on account of his having delayed his repentance to the last. 4 Three hours twenty minutes; fifteen degrees being reckoned to an hour.

For that, whereby we hearken, is one power; Another that, which the whole spirit hath: This is as it were bound, while that is free.

This moves him to express a doubt to his guide, how the dead can be profited by the prayers of the living; for the solution of which doubt he is referred to Beatrice. Afterward he meets with Sordello the Mantuan, whose affection, shown to Virgil his countryman, leads Dante to break forth into an invective against the unnatural divisions with which Italy, and more especially Florence, was distracted. HEN from their game of dice men separate, He who hath lost remains in sadness fix’d, Revolving in his mind what luckless throws He cast: but, meanwhile, all the company Go with the other; one before him runs, And one behind his mantle twitches, one Fast by his side bids him remember him.

The courtiers envying the high place which he held in the King’s favor, prevailed on Mary of Brabant to charge him falsely with an attempt upon her person; for which supposed crime he suffered death. So say the Italian commentators. Henault represents the matter very differently: “Pierre de la Brosse, formerly barber to St. Louis, afterward the favorite of Philip, fearing the too great attachment of the King for his wife Mary, accuses this princess of having poisoned Louis, eldest son of Philip, by his first marriage. This calumny is discovered by a nun of Nivelle, in Flanders. La Brosse is hanged.”

Besides, when I this point concluded thus, By praying no defect could be supplied; Because the prayer had none access to God. Yet in this deep suspicion rest thou not Contented, unless she assure thee so, Who betwixt truth and mind infuses light: I know not if thou take me right; I mean Beatrice. Her thou shalt behold above, Upon this mountain’s crown, fair seat of joy.” Then I: “Sir! let us mend our speed; for now I tire not as before: and lo! the hill® Stretches its shadow far.” He answer’d thus: “Our progress with this day shall be as much As we may now despatch; but otherwise Than thou supposest is the truth. For there Thou canst not be, ere thou once more behold Him back returning, who behind the steep Is now so hidden, that, as erst, his beam Thou dost not break. But lo! a spirit there Stands solitary, and toward us looks: It will instruct us in the speediest way.” We soon approach’d it. O thou Lombard spirit! How didst thou stand, in high abstracted mood, Scarce moving with slow dignity thine eyes. It spoke not aught, but let us onward pass, Eying us as a lion on his ‘watch. But Virgil, with entreaty mild, advanced, Requesting it to show the best ascent. It answer to his question none return’d; But of our country and our kind of life Demanded.

He distinguished himself by his skill in Provencal poetry and many feats of military prowess have been attributed to him. It is probable that he was born at the end of the twelfth, and died about the middle of the succeeding, century. 10The Emperor Albert I succeeded Adolphus in 1298, and was murdered in 1308.

CANTO VII ARGUMENT.—The approach of night hindering further ascent, Sordello conducts our Poet apart to an eminence, from whence they behold a pleasant recess, in form of a flowery valley, scooped out of the mountain; where are many famous spirits, and among them the Emperor Rodolph, Ottocar, King of Bohemia, Philip III of France, Henry of Navarre, Peter III of Arragon, Charles 1 of Naples, Henry III of England, and William, Marquis of Montferrat. FTER their courteous greetings joyfully Seven times exchanged, Sordello backward drew Exclaiming, “Who are ye?” —“Before this mount By spirits worthy of ascent to God Was sought, my bones had by Octavius’ care Been buried. I am Virgil; for no sin Deprived of Heaven, except for lack of faith.” So answer’d him in few my gentle guide. As one, who aught before him suddenly Beholding, whence his wonder riseth, cries, “It is, yet is not,” wavering in belief; Such he appear’d; then downward bent his eyes, And, drawing near with reverential step, Caught him, where one of mean estate might clasp His lord. “Glory of Latium!” he exclaim’d, “In whom our tongue its utmost power display’d; Boast of my honor’d birth-place! what desert Of mine, what favour, rather, undeserved, Shows thee to me? If I to hear that voice Am worthy, say if from below thou comest,

CANTO VII PURGATORY 171 And from what cloister’s pale.”—“Through every orb Of that sad region,” he replied, “thus far Am I arrived, by heavenly influence led: And with such aid I come. Not for my doing, But for not doing, have I lost the sight Of that high Sun, whom thou desirest, and who By me too late was known. There is a place! There underneath, not made by torments sad, But by dun shades alone; where mourning’s voice Sounds not of anguish sharp, but breathes in sighs. There I with little innocents abide, Who by death’s fangs were bitten, ere exempt From human taint. There I with those abide, Who the three holy virtues? put not on, But understood the rest,’ and without blame Follow’d them all. But, if thou know’st, and canst, Direct us how we soonest may arrive, Where Purgatory its true beginning takes.” He answer’d thus: “We have no certain place Assign’d us: upward I may go, or round. Far as I can, I join thee for thy guide. But thou beholdest now how day declines; And upward to proceed by night, our power Excels: therefore it may be well to choose A place of pleasant sojourn. To the right Some spirits sit apart retired. If thou Consentest, I to these will lead thy steps: And thou wilt know them, not without delight.” “How chances this?” was answer’d: “whoso wish’d To ascend by night, would he be thence debarr’d By other, or through his own weakness fail?” The good Sordello then, along the ground Trailing his finger, spoke: “Only this line Thou shalt not overpass, soon as the sun Hath disappear’d; not that aught else impedes Thy going upward, save the shades of night. These, with the want of power, perplex the will. 1 Limbo. See Hell, Canto iv. 24. 3“The rest.” Prudence, Justice, Forti2 Faith, Hope, and Charity. tude, and Temperance.

Refulgent gold, and silver thrice refined, And scarlet grain and ceruse, Indian wood Of lucid dye serene, fresh emeralds But newly broken, by the herbs and flowers Placed in that fair recess, in color all Had been surpass’d, as great surpasses less. Nor nature only there lavish’d her hues, But of the sweetness of a thousand smells A rare and undistinguish’d fragrance made. “Salve Regina,” ‘ on the grass and flowers, Here chanting, I beheld those spirits sit, Who not beyond the valley could be seen. “Before the westering sun sink to his bed,” Began the Mantuan, who our steps had turn’d, “’Mid those, desire not that I lead ye on. For from this eminence ye shall discern Better the acts and visages of all, Than, in the nether vale, among them mix’d. He, who sits high above the rest, and seems To have neglected that he should have done, And to the others’ song moves not his lip, The Emperor Rodolph call, who might have heal’d The wounds whereof fair Italy hath died, 4“Salve Regina.” The beginning of a prayer to the Virgin.

He, who with kindly visage comforts him, Sway'd in that country,® where the water springs, That Moldaw’s river to the Elbe, and Elbe Rolls to the ocean: Ottocar® his name: Who in his swaddling-clothes was of more worth Than Wenceslaus his son, a bearded man, Pamper’d with rank luxuriousness and ease. And that one with the nose deprest,’ who close In counsel seems with him of gentle look,* Flying expired, withering the lily’s flower. Look there, how he doth knock against his breast. The other ye behold, who for his cheek Makes of one hand a couch, with frequent sighs. They are the father and the father-in-law Of Gallia’s bane:® his vicious life they know And foul; thence comes the grief that rends them thus. “He, so robust of limb,’ who measure keeps In song with him of feature prominent,"! With every virtue bore his girdle braced. 5“That country.” Bohemia. 6 “Ottocar.” King of Bohemia, who was killed in the battle of Marchfield, fought with Rodolph, August 26, 1278. Wenceslaus II, his son, who succeeded him in the Kingdom of Bohemia, died in 1305. The latter is again taxed with luxury in the Paradise, xix. 123. ™That one with the nose deprest.” Philip III, of France, father of Philip IV. He died in 1285, at Perpignan, in his retreat from Arragon. 8“Him of gentle look.” Henry of Navarre, father of Jane, married to Philip IV, of France, whom Dante calls “mal di Francia.”"—"Gallia’s bane.” 9“Gallia’s bane.” G,. Villani, lib. vii. cap. cxlvi, speaks with equal resentment of Philip IV. “In 1291, on the night of the calends of May, Philip le Bel, King of France, by advice of Biccio and Musciatto Franzesi, ordered al! the Italians, who were in his country and realm, to be seized, under pretence of seizing the money-lenders, but thus he caused the good merchants also to be seized and ransomed; for which he was much blamed and held in great abhorrence. And from thenceforth the realm of France fell evermore into degradation and decline. And it is observable that between the taking of Acre and this seizure in France, the merchants of Florence received great damage and ruin of their property.” 10 “He, so robust of limb.” Peter Il, called the Great, King of Arragon, who died in 1285, leaving four sons, Alonzo, James, Frederick, and Peter. The two former succeeded him in the Kingdom of Arragon, and Frederick in that of Sicily. 11“Him of feature prominent.” “Dal maschio naso"—“with the masculine nose.” Charles I, King of Naples, Count of Anjou, and brother of St. Louis. He died in 1284. The annalist of Florence remarks that “there had been no sovereign of the house of France, since the time of Charlemagne, by whom Charles was surpassed either in military renown and prowess, or in the loftiness of his understanding.”

174 THE DIVINE COMEDY CANTO VII And if that stripling,'? who behind him sits, King after him had lived, his virtue then From vessel to like vessel had been pour’d; Which may not of the other heirs be said.

Rarely into the branches of the tree Doth human worth mount up: and so ordains He who bestows it, that as His free gift It may be call’d. To Charles’? my words apply No less than to his brother in song; Which Pouille and Provence now with grief confess. So much that plant degenerates from its seed, As, more than Beatrix and Margaret, Costanza" still boasts of her valorous spouse. “Behold the King of simple life and plain, Harry of England,'® sitting there alone: He through his branches better issue'® spreads. “That one, who, on the ground, beneath the rest, Sits lowest, yet his gaze directs aloft, Is William, that brave Marquis,"’ for whose cause, The deed of Alexandria and his war Makes Montferrat and Canavese weep.” 12That stripling.” Either (as the old commentators suppose) Alonzo III, King of Arragon, the eldest son of Peter III, who died in 1291, at the age of 27; or, according to Venturi, Peter, the youngest son. The former was a young prince of virtue sufficient to have justified the eulogium and the hopes of Dante. 13 “To Charles.” ‘‘Al Nausto”—Charles Il, King of Naples, is no less inferior to his father, Charles I, than James and Frederick to theirs, Peter HI. 4 “Costanza.” Widow of Peter III. She has been already mentioned in the third Canto, v. 112. By Beatrix and Margaret are probably meant two of the daughters of Raymond Berenger, Count of Provence; the latter married to St. Louis of France, the former to his brother Charles of Anjou, King of Naples. See Paradise, Canto vi. 135. Dante therefore considers Peter as the most illustrious of the three monarchs. 38 “Harry of England.” Henry Ill. The contemporary annalist speaks of this king in similar terms. G. Villani, lib. v. cap. iv. “From Richard was born Henry, who reigned after him, who was a plain man of good faith, but of little courage.” 16 “Better issuc."” Edward I, of whose glory our Poet was perhaps a witness, in his visit to England. “From the said Henry was born the good King Edward, who reigns in our times, who has done great things, whercof we shall make mention in due place."—G. Villani, ibid. 17 “William, that brave Marquis.” William, Marquis of Montferrat, was treacherously seized by his own subjects, at Alessandria in Lombardy, A. D. 1290, and ended his life in prison. A war ensued between the people of Alessandria and those of Montferrat and the Canavese, now part of Piedmont.

CANTO VIII PURGATORY 175 CANTO VIII ArGUMENT.—Two Angels, with flaming swords broken at the points, descend to keep watch over the valley, into which Virgil and Dante entering by desire of Sordello, our Poet mects with joy the spirit of Nino, the judge of Gallura, one who was well known to him. Meantime three exceedingly bright stars appear near the pole, and a serpent creeps subtly into the valley, but flees at hearing the approach of those angelic guards. Lastly, Conrad Malaspina predicts to our Poet his future banishment. OW was the hour that wakens fond desire In men at sea, and melts their thoughtful heart Who in the morn have bid sweet friends farewell, And pilgrim newly on his road with love Thrills, if he hear the vesper bell from far, That seems to mourn for the expiring day: When I, no longer taking heed to hear, Began, with wonder, from those spirits to mark One risen from its seat, which with its hand Audience implored. Both palms it join’d and raised, Fixing its stedfast gaze toward the east, As telling God, “I care for naught beside.” “Te Lucis Ante,” ' so devoutly then Came from its lip, and in so soft a strain, That all my sense in ravishment was lost. And the rest after, softly and devout, Follow’d through all the hymn, with upward gaze Directed to the bright supernal wheels. Here, reader! for the truth make thine eyes keen: For of so subtle texture is this veil, That thou with ease mayst pass it through unmark’d. I saw that gentle band silently next Look up, as if in expectation held, Pale and in lowly guise; and, from on high, I saw, forth issuing descend beneath, Two Angels, with two flame-illumined swords, Broken and mutilated of their points. Green as the tender leaves but newly born, Their vesture was, the which, by wings as green Beaten, they drew behind them, fann’d in air, A litdle over us one took his stand; '“Te lucis ante terminum,” the first verse of the hymn in the last part of the sacred office, termed “‘complin.”

176 THE DIVINE COMEDY CANTO VIII The other lighted on the opposing hill; So that the troop were in the midst contain’d. Well I descried the whiteness on their heads; But in their visages the dazzled eye Was lost, as faculty that by too much Ts overpower’d. “From Mary’s bosom both Are come,” exclaim’d Sordello, “as a guard Over the vale, ’gainst him, who hither tends, The serpent.” Whence, not knowing by which path He came, I turn’d me round; and closely press'd, All frozen, to my leader’s trusted side. Sordello paused not: “To the valley now (For it is time) let us descend; and hold Converse with those great shadows: haply much Their sight may please ye.” Only three steps down Methinks I measured, ere I was beneath, And noted one who look’d as with desire To know me. Time was now that air grew dim; Yet not so dim, that, ’twixt his eyes and mine, It clear’d not up what was conceal’d before. Mutually toward each other we advanced. Nino, thou courteous judge!? what joy I felt, When I perceived thou wert not with the bad. No salutation kind on either part Was left unsaid. He then inquired: “How long, Since thou arrived’st at the mountain’s foot, Over the distant waves?”—“Oh!” answer’d I, “Through the sad seats of woe this morn I came; And still in my first life, thus journeying on, The other strive to gain.” Soon as they heard My words, he and Sordello backward drew, As suddenly amazed. To Virgil one, The other to a spirit turn’d, who near Was seated, crying: “Conrad!* up with speed: Come, see what of His grace high God hath will’d.” Then turning round to me: “By that rare mark Of honour, which thou owest to Him, who hides So deeply His first cause it hath no ford; 2 Nino di Gallura de’ Visconti, nephew betrayed by him. to Count Ugolino de’ Gherardeschi, and 3 Father to Marcello Malaspina.

CANTO VIII PURGATORY When thou shalt be beyond the vast of waves, Tell my Giovanna,‘ that for me she call There, where reply to innocence is made. Her mother,' I believe, loves me no more; Since she has changed the white and wimpled folds, Which she is doom’d once more with grief to wish. By her it easily may be perceived, How long in woman lasts the flame of love, If sight and touch do not relume it oft. For her so fair a burial will not make The viper,’ which calls Milan to the field, As had been made by shrill Gallura’s bird.” ® He spoke, and in his visage took the stamp Of that right zeal, which with due temperature Glows in the bosom. My insatiate eyes Meanwhile to Heaven had travel’d, even there Where the bright stars are slowest, as a wheel Nearest the axle; when my guide inquired: “What there aloft, my son, has caught thy gaze?” I answer’d: “The three torches,® with which here The pole is all on fire.” He then to me: “The four resplendent stars, thou saw’st this morn, Are there beneath; and these, risen in their stead.” While yet he spoke, Sordello to himself Drew him, and cried: “Lo there our enemy!” And with his hand pointed that way to look. Along the side, where barrier none arose Around the little vale, a serpent lay, Such haply as gave Eve the bitter food. Between the grass and flowers, the evil snake Came on, reverting oft his lifted head; 4The daughter of Nino, and wife of Riccardo da Camino, of Trevigi. 5“Her mother.” Beatrice, Marchioness of Este, wife of Nino, and after his death married to Galeazzo de’ Visconti of Milan. 6 The weeds of widowhood. 7 The arms of Galeazzo and the ensign of the Milanese. 8 The cock was the ensign of Gallura, Nino's province in Sardinia. It is not known whether Beatrice had any further cause to regret her nuptials with Galeazzo, than a certain shame which appears, however unreasonably, to have attached to a second marriage. ®The three evangelical virtues, Faith, Hope, and Charity, are supposed to rise in the evening, to denote their belonging to the contemplative; as the four others are made to rise in the morning to signify their belonging to the active life: or perhaps it may mark the succession, in order of time, of the Gospel to the heathen system of morality.

178 THE DIVINE COMEDY CANTO VIII And, as a beast that smooths its polish'd coat, Licking his back. I saw not, nor can tell, How those celestial falcons from their seat Moved, but in motion each one well descried. Hearing the air cut by their verdant plumes, The serpent fled; and, to their stations, back The Angels up return’d with equal flight. The spirit, (who to Nino, when he call'd, Had come), from viewing me with fixed ken, Through all that conflict, loosen’d not his sight. “So may the lamp, which leads thee up on high, Find, in thy free resolve, of wax so much, As may suffice thee to the enamel’d height.” It thus began: “If any certain news Of Valdimagra and the neighbour part Thou know’st, tell me, who once was mighty there. They call’d me Conrad Malaspina; not That old one, but from him I sprang. The love I bore my people is now here refined.” “In your domains,” I answer’d, “ne’er was I. But, through all Europe, where do those men dwell, To whom their glory is not manifest? The fame, that honours your illustrious house, Proclaims the nobles, and proclaims the land; So that he knows it, who was never there. I swear to you, so may my upward route Prosper, your honoured nation not impairs The value of her coffer and her sword. Nature and use give her such privilege, That while the world is twisted from his course By a bad head, she only walks aright, And has the evil way in scorn.” He then: “Now pass thee on: seven times the tired sun’?

CANTO IX PURGATORY With stronger nails than other’s speech can drive; If the sure course of judgment be not stay’d.” CANTO IX 179 ArcuMENT.—Dante is carried up the mountain, asleep and dreaming, by Lucia; and, on awakening, finds himself, two hours after sunrise, with Virgil, near the gate of Purgatory, through which they are admitted by the Angel deputed by St. Peter to keep it. 1“Of that chill animal.” 2“The third was closing up its wing.” The night being divided into four watches, OW the fair consort of Tithonus old, Arisen from her mate’s beloved arms, Look’d palely o’er the eastern cliff; her brow, Lucent with jewels, glitter’d, set in sign Of that chill animal,! who with his train Smites fearful nations: and where then we were, Two steps of her ascent the night had past; And now the third was closing up its wing,’ When I, who had so much of Adam with me, Sank down upon the grass, o’ercome with sleep, There where all five* were seated. In that hour, When near the dawn the swallow her sad lay, Remembering haply ancient grief,’ renews; And when our minds, more wanderers from the flesh, And less by thought restrain’d, are, as t were, full Of holy divination in their dreams; Then, in a vision, did I seem to view A golden-feather’d eagle in the sky, With open wings, and hovering for descent; And I was in that place, methought, from whence Young Ganymede, from his associates ’reft, Was snatch’d aloft to the high consistory. “Perhaps,” thought I within me, “here alone He strikes his quarry, and elsewhere disdains The scorpion. difficulty in the first verse. 3“All five.” which would still leave an insurmountable Virgil, Dante, Sordello, I think he may mean that the third was past, and the fourth and last was begun, so that there might be some faint glimmering of morning twilight; and not merely, as Lombardi supposes, that the third watch was drawing toward its close, Nino, and Corrado Malaspina. 4“Remembering haply ancient grief.” Progne having been changed into a swallow after the outrage done her by Tereus.

There both, I thought, the eagle and myself Did burn; and so intense the imagined flames, That needs my sleep was broken off. As erst Achilles shook himself, and round him roll’d His waken’d eyeballs, wondering where he was, Whenas his mother had from Chiron fled To Scyros, with him sleeping in her arms; There whence the Greeks did after sunder him; E’en thus I shook me, soon as from my face The slumber parted, turning deadly pale, Like one ice-struck with dread. Sole at my side My comfort stood: and the bright sun was now More than two hours aloft: and to the sea My looks were turn’d. “Fear not,” my master cried, “Assured we are at happy point. Thy strength Shrink not, but rise dilated. Thou art come To Purgatory now. Lo! there the cliff That circling bounds it. Lo! the entrance there, Where it doth seem disparted. Ere the dawn Usher’d the day-light, when thy wearied soul Slept in thee, o’er the flowery vale beneath A lady came, and thus bespake me: ‘I Am Lucia.’ Suffer me to take this man, Who slumbers. Easier so his way shall speed.’ Sordello and the other gentle shapes Tarrying, she bare thee up: and, as day shone, This summit reach’d: and I pursued her steps. Here did she place thee. First, her lovely eyes That open entrance show’d me; then at once She vanish’d with thy sleep.” Like one, whose doubts Are chased by certainty, and terror turn’d To comfort on discovery of the truth, Such was the change in me: and as my guide Beheld me fearless, up along the cliff He moved, and I behind him, toward the height. § “Lucia.” See Hell, ¢. ii 97 and Paradise, c. xxxii. 123.

CANTO IX PURGATORY 181 Reader! thou markest how my theme doth rise; Nor wonder therefore, if more artfully I prop the structure. Nearer now we drew, Arrived whence, in that part, where first a breach As of a wall appear’d, I could descry A portal, and three steps beneath, that led For inlet there, of different colour each; And one who watch’d, but spake not yet a word. As more and more mine eye did stretch its view, I mark’d him seated on the highest step, In visage such, as past my power to bear. Grasp’d in his hand, a naked sword glanced back The rays so toward me, that I oft in vain My sight directed. “Speak, from whence ye stand;” He cried: “What would ye? Where is your escort? Take heed your coming upward harm ye not.” “A heavenly dame, not skill-less of these things,” Replied the instructor, “told us, even now, ‘Pass that way: here the gate is.’”—“And may she, Befriending, prosper your ascent,” resumed The courteous keeper of the gate: “Come then Before our steps.” We straightway thither came. The lowest stair® was marble white, so smooth And polish’d, that therein my mirror’d form Distinct I saw. The next of hue more dark Than sablest grain, a rough and singed block, Crack’d lengthwise and across. The third, that lay Massy above, seem’d porphyry, that flamed Red as the life-blood spouting from a vein. On this God’s angel either foot sustain’d, Upon the threshold seated, which appear’d A rock of diamond. Up the trinal steps My leader cheerly drew me. “Ask,” said he, “With humble heart, that he unbar the bolt.” Piously at his holy feet devolved I cast me, praying him for pity’s sake That he would open to me; but first fell ®The white step suggests the con- contrition on their account; the porphyry, science of the penitent reflecting his of- the fervor with which he resolves on the fences; the burnt and cracked one, his future pursuit of piety and virtue.

182 THE DIVINE COMEDY CANTO IX Thrice on my bosom prostrate. Seven times’ The letter, that denotes the inward stain, He, on my forehead, with the blunted point Of his drawn sword, inscribed. And “Look,” he cried, “When enter’d, that thou wash these scars away.” Ashes, or earth ta’en dry out of the ground, Were of one colour with the robe he wore. From underneath that vestment forth he drew Two keys,® of metal twain: the one was gold, Its fellow silver. With the pallid first, And next the burnish’d, he so ply’d the gate, As to content me well. “Whenever one Faileth of these, that in the key-hole straight It turn not, to this alley then expect Access in vain.” Such were the words he spake. “One is more precious:® but the other needs Skill and sagacity, large share of each, Ere its good task to disengage the knot Be worthily perform’d. From Peter these I hold, of him instructed that I err Rather in opening, than in keeping fast; So but the suppliant at my feet implore.” Then of that hallow’d gate he thrust the door, Exclaiming, “Enter, but this warning hear: He forth again departs who looks behind.” As in the hinges of that sacred ward The swivels turn’d, sonorous metal strong, Harsh was the grating; nor so surlily Roar’d the Tarpeian, when by force bereft Of good Metellus, thenceforth from his loss To leanness doom’d. Attentively I turn’d, Listening the thunder that first issued forth; And “We praise thee, O God,” methought I heard, 7 “Seven times.” Seven P's, to denote the seven sins (Peccata) of which he was to be cleansed in his passage through Purgatory. 8“Two keys.” Lombardi remarks that painters have usually drawn St. Peter with two keys, the one of gold and the other of silver; but that Niccolo Alemanni, in his Dissertation de Parietinis Lateranensibus, produces instances of his being represented with one key, and with three. We have here, however, not St. Peter, but an angel deputed by him. ®°The golden key denotes the divine authority by which the priest absolves the sinners; the silver, the learning and judgment requisite for the due discharge of that office.

CANTO X PURGATORY 183 In accents blended with sweet melody. The strains came o'er mine ear, e’en as the sound Of choral voices, that in solemn chant With organ’® mingle, and now high and clear Come swelling, now float indistinct away. CANTO X ARGUMENT.—Being admitted at the gate of Purgatory, our Poets ascend a winding path up the rock, till they reach an open and level space that extends each way round the mountain. On the side that rises, and which is of white marble, are seen artfully engraven many stories of humility, which whilst they are contemplating, there approach the souls of those who expiate the sin of pride, and who are bent down beneath the weight of heavy stones. HEN we had passed the threshold of the gate, (Which the soul’s ill affection doth disuse, Making the crooked seem the straighter path,) I heard its closing sound. Had mine eyes turn’d, For that offence what plea might have avail’d? We mounted up the riven rock, that wound On either side alternate, as the wave Flies and advances. “Here some litte art Behoves us,” said my leader, “that our steps Observe the varying flexure of the path.” Thus we so slowly sped, that with cleft orb The moon once more o’erhangs her watery couch, Ere we that strait have threaded. But when free, We came, and open, where the mount above One solid mass retires; I spent with toil, And both uncertain of the way, we stood, Upon a plain more lonesome than the roads That traverse desert wilds. From whence the brink Borders upon vacuity, to foot Of the steep bank that rises still, the space Had measured thrice the stature of a man: And, distant as mine eye could wing its flight, To leftward now and now to right despatch’d, That cornice equal in extent appear’d. 1©“Organ.” Organs were used in Italy the Emperor Julian's writings, which as early as in the sixth century. If I shows that the organ was not unknown remember rightly there is a passage in in his time.

184 THE DIVINE COMEDY CANTO X Not yet our feet had on that summit moved, When I discover’d that the bank, around, Whose proud uprising all ascent denied, Was marble white; and so exactly wrought With quaintest sculpture, that not there alone Had Polycletus, but e’en nature’s self Been shamed. The Angel (who came down to earth With tidings of the peace so many years Wept for in vain, that oped the heavenly gates From their long interdict) before us seem’d, In a sweet act, so sculptured to the life, He look’d no silent image. One had sworn He had said “Hail!” for she was imaged there, By whom the key did open to God’s love; And in her act as sensibly imprest That word, “Behold the handmaid of the Lord,” As figure seal’d on wax. “Fix not thy mind On one place only,” said the guide beloved, Who had me near him on that part where lies The heart of man. My sight forthwith I turn’d, And mark’d, behind the Virgin Mother’s form, Upon that side where he that moved me stood, Another story graven on the rock. I past athwart the bard, and drew me near, That it might stand more aptly for my view. There, in the self-same marble, were engraved The cart and kine, drawing the sacred ark, That from unbidden office awes mankind. Before it came much people; and the whole Parted in seven quires. One sense cried “Nay,” Another, “Yes, they sing.” Like doubt arose Betwixt the eye and smell, from the curl'd fume Of incense breathing up the well-wrought toil. Preceding the blest vessel, onward came With light dance leaping, girt in humble guise, Israel’s sweet harper: in that hap he seem’d Less, and yet more, than kingly. Opposite At a great palace, from the lattice forth Look’d Michol, like a lady full of scorn And sorrow. To behold the tablet next,

CANTO X PURGATORY Which, at the back of Michol, whitely shone, I moved me. There, was storied on the rock The exalted glory of the Roman prince, Whose mighty worth moved Gregory! to earn His mighty conquest, Trajan the Emperor. A widow at his bridle stood, attired In tears and mourning. Round about them troop’d Full throng of knights; and overhead in gold The eagles floated, struggling with the wind. The wretch appear’d amid all these to say: “Grant vengeance, Sire! for, woe beshrew this heart, My son is murder’d.” He replying seem’d: “Wait now till I return.” And she, as one Made hasty by her grief: “O Sire! if thou Dost not return?” —‘“Where I am, who then is, May right thee.” —“What to thee is other’s good, If thou neglect thy own?”—“Now comfort thee;” At length he answers. “It beseemeth well My duty be perform’d, ere I move hence: So justice wills; and pity bids me stay.” He, whose ken nothing new surveys, produced That visible speaking, new to us and strange, The like not found on earth. Fondly I gazed Upon those patterns of meck humbleness, Shapes yet more precious for their artist's sake; When “Lo!” the poet whisper’d, “where this way (But slack their pace) a multitude advance, These to the lofty steps shall guide us on.” Mine eyes, though bent on view of novel sights, Their loved allurement, were not slow to turn. Reader! I would not that amazed thou miss Of thy good purpose, hearing how just God Decrees our debts be cancel’d. Ponder not The form of suffering. Think on what succeeds: Think that, at worst, beyond the mighty doom It cannot pass. “Instructor!” TI began, “What I see hither tending, bears no trace Of human semblance, nor of aught beside t“Gregory.” St. Gregory's prayers are said to have delivered Trajan from hell.

But look intently thither; And disentangle with thy laboring view, What, underneath those stones, approacheth: now, E’en now, mayst thou discern the pangs of each.” Christians and proud! O poor and wretched ones! That, feeble in the mind’s eye, lean your trust Upon unstaid perverseness: know ye not That we are worms, yet made at last to form The winged insect,? imp’d with angel plumes, That to Heaven’s justice unobstructed soars? Why buoy ye up aloft your unfledged souls? Abortive then and shapeless ye remain, Like the untimely embryon of a worm. As, to support incumbent floor or roof, For corbel, is a figure sometimes seen, That crumples up its knees unto its breast; With the feign’d posture, stirring ruth unfeign’d In the beholder’s fancy; so I saw These fashion’d, when I noted well their guise. Each, as his back was laden, came indeed Or more or less contracted; and it seem’d As he, who show’d most patience in his look, Wailing exclaim’d: “I can endure no more.” CANTO XI ARGUMENT.—After a prayer uttered by the spirits, who were spoken of in the last Canto, Virgil inquires the way upward, and is answered by one, who declares himself to have been Omberto, son of the Count of Santafiore. Next our Poet distinguishes Oderigi, the illuminator, who discourses on the vanity of worldly fame, and points out to him the soul of Provenzano Salvani. THOU Almighty Father! who dost make The heavens Thy dwelling, not in bounds confined, But that, with love intenser, there Thou view’st Thy primal effluence; hallow’d be Thy name: Join, each created being, to extol ?“The winged insect.” The butterfly was an ancient and well-known symbol of the human soul.

His talents were discovered by Cimabue, while he was tending sheep for his father in the neighborhood of Florence, and he was afterward patronized by Pope Benedict XI and Robert, King of Naples; and enjoyed the society and friendship of Dante, whose likeness he has transmitted to posterity. 5 Guido Cavalcanti, the friend of our Poet, had eclipsed the literary fame of Guido Guinicelli.

Thus he still hath gone, Thus goeth never-resting, since he died. Such is the acquittance render'd back of him, Who, in the mortal Jife, too much hath dared.” I then: “If soul, that to life’s verge delays Repentance, linger in that lower space, Nor hither mount, (unless good prayers befriend), Or ever time, long as it lived, be past; How chanced admittance was vouchsafed to him?” “When at his glory’s topmost height,” said he, “Respect of dignity all cast aside, Freely he fix’d him on Siena’s plain, A suitor® to redeem his suffering friend, Who languish'd in the prison-house of Charles; Nor, for his sake, refused through every vein To tremble.

I now my leader’s track not loth pursued; And each had shown how light we fared along, When thus he warned me: “Bend thine eyesight down, For thou, to ease the way, shalt find it good To ruminate the bed beneath thy feet.” As, in memorial of the buried, drawn Upon carth-level tombs, the sculptured form Of what was once, appears, (at sight whereof Tears often stream forth, by remembrance waked, Whose sacred stings the piteous often feel), So saw I there, but with more curious skill Of portraiture o’erwrought, whate’er of space From forth the mountain stretches.

Because ye point your wishes at a mark, Where, by communion of possessors, part Is lessen’d, envy bloweth up men’s sighs. No fear of that might touch ye, if the love Of higher sphere exalted your desire.

How can it chance, that good distributed, The many, that possess it, makes more rich, Than if ’t were shared by few?” He answering thus: “Thy mind, reverting still to things of earth, 205 Strikes darkness from true light.

Their prelude still Was “Agnus Dei”; and through all the choir, One voice, one measure ran, that perfect seem’d The concord of their song. ‘Are these J hear Spirits, O master?” I exclaim’d; and he, “Thou aim’st aright: these loose the bonds of wrath.” “Now who art thou, that through our smoke dost cleave, And speak’st of us, as thou thyself e’en yet Dividedst time by calends?” So one voice Bespake me; whence my master said, “Reply; And ask, if upward hence the passage lead.” “O being! who dost make thee pure, to stand Beautiful once more in thy Maker’s sight; Along with me: and thou shalt hear and wonder.” Thus I, whereto the spirit answering spake: “Long as ’tis lawful for me, shall my steps Follow on thine; and since the cloudy smoke

CANTO XVII ARGUMENT.—The Poet issues from that thick vapour; and soon after his fancy represents to him in lively portraiture some noted examples of anger. This imagination is dissipated by the appearance of an angel, who marshals them onward to the fourth cornice, on which the sin of gloominess or indifference is purged; and here Virgil shows him that this vice proceeds from a defect of love, and that all love can be only of two sorts, either natural, or of the soul; of which sorts the former is always right, but the latter may err either in respect of object or of degree. ALL to remembrance, reader, if thou e’er Hast on an Alpine height been ta’en by cloud, Through which thou saw’st no better than the mole Doth through opacous membrane; then, whene’er The watery vapours dense began to melt Into thin air, how faintly the sun’s sphere Seem’d wading through them: so thy nimble thought May image, how at first I rebeheld The sun, that bedward now his couch o’erhung.

As of itself That unsubstantial coinage of the brain Burst, like a bubble, when the water fails That fed it; in my vision straight uprose A damsel? weeping loud, and cried, “O queen! O mother! wherefore has intemperate ire Driven thee to loathe thy being? Not to lose Lavinia, desperate thou hast slain thyself. Now hast thou lost me. I am she, whose tears Mourn, ere I fall, a mother’s timeless end.” E’en as a sleep breaks off, if suddenly New radiance strikes upon the closed lids, The broken slumber quivering ere it dies; Thus, from before me, sunk that imagery, Vanishing, soon as on my face there struck The light, outshining far our earthly beam. 11 cannot think, with Vellutello, that the swallow is here meant. Dante probably alludes to the story of Philomela, as it is found in Homer's “Odyssey,” b. xix. 518. Philomela intended to slay the son of her husband's brother Amphion, incited to it by the envy of his wife, who had six children, while herself had only two, but through mistake slew her own son Itylus, and for her punishment was transformed by Jupiter into a nightingale. 2 Lavinia, mourning for her mother Amata, who, impelled by grief and indignation for the supposed death of Turnus, destroyed herself.

Refuse we not to lend a ready foot At such inviting: haste we to ascend, Before it darken: for we may not then, Till morn again return.” So spake my guide; And to one ladder both address’d our steps; And the first stair approaching, I perceived Near me as ’t were the waving of a wing, That fann’d my face, and whisper’d: “Blessed they, The peace-makers: they know not evil wrath.” Now to such height above our heads were raised The last beams, follow’d close by hooded night, That many a star on all sides through the gloom Shone out. “Why partest from me, O my strength?” So with myself I communed; for I felt My o’ertoil’d sinews slacken. We had reach’d The summit, and were fix'd like to a bark Arrived at land. And waiting a short space, If aught should meet mine ear in that new round, Then to my guide I turn’d, and said: “Loved sire!

The Poet, pursuing his meditations, falls into a dreamy slumber. HE teacher ended, and his high discourse Concluding, earnest in my looks inquired If I appear’d content; and I, whom still Unsated thirst to hear him urged, was mute, Mute outwardly, yet inwardly I said: “Perchance my too much questioning offends.” But he, true father, mark’d the secret wish By diffidence restrain’d; and, speaking, gave Me boldness thus to speak: “Master! my sight Gathers so lively virtue from thy beams, That all, thy words convey, distinct is seen.

Beneath it were a multitude, that raised Their hands, and shouted forth I know not what Unto the boughs; like greedy and fond brats, That beg, and answer none obtain from him, Of whom they beg; but more to draw them on, He, at arm’s length, the object of their wish Above them holds aloft, and hides it not. At length, as undeceived, they went their way: And we approach the tree, whom vows and tears Sue to in vain; the mighty tree. “Pass on, And come not near. Stands higher up the wood, Whereof Eve tasted: and from it was ta’en This plant.” Such sounds from midst the thickets came Whence I, with either bard, close to the side That rose, pass’d forth beyond. “Remember,” next We heard, “those unblest creatures of the clouds,’ How they their twyfold bosoms, overgorged, Opposed in fight to Theseus: call to mind The Hebrews, how, effeminate, they stoop’d To ease their thirst; whence Gideon’s ranks were thinn’d, As he to Midian® march’d adown the hills.” Thus near one border coasting, still we heard The sins of gluttony, with woe erewhile Reguerdon’d.

Again drew near my side the very same, Who had erewhile besought me; and their looks Mark’d eagerness to listen. I, who twice Their will had noted, spake: ‘“O spirits! secure, Whene’er the time may be, of peaceful end; My limbs, nor crude, nor in mature old age, Have I left yonder: here they bear me, fed With blood, and sinew-strung.

CANTO XXVII ArGUMENT.—An Angel sends them forward through the fire to the last ascent, which leads to the terrestrial Paradise, situated on the summit of the mountain. They have not proceeded many steps on their way upward, when the fall of night hinders them from going further; and our Poet, who has lain down with Virgil and Statius to rest, beholds in a dream two females, figuring the active and contemplative life. With the return af morning, they reach the height; and here Virgil gives Dante full liberty to use his own pleasure and judgment in the choice of his way, tll he shall meet with Beatrice. OW was the sun! so station’d, as when first His early radiance quivers on the heights, Where stream’d his Maker’s blood; while Libra hangs Above Hesperian Ebro; and new fires, Meridian, flash on Ganges’ yellow tide. So day was sinking, when the Angel of God Appear'd before us. Joy was in his mien. Forth of the flame he stood upon the brink; And with a voice, whose lively clearness far Surpass’d our human, “Blessed? are the pure In heart,” he sang: then near him as we came, “Go ye not further, holy spirits!” he cried, “Ere the fire pierce you: enter in; and list Attentive to the song ye hear from thence.” I, when I heard his saying, was as one Laid in the grave. My hands together clasp’d, And upward stretching, on the fire I look’d; And busy fancy conjured up the forms Erewhile beheld alive consumed in flames. The escorting spirits turn’d with gentle looks Toward me; and the Mantuan spake: “My son, Here torment thou mayst feel, but canst not death.

Somewhat disturb’d he cried: “Mark now, my son, From Beatrice thou art by this wall Divided.” As at Thisbe’s name the eye Of Pyramus was open’d, (when life ebb’d Fast from his veins), and took one parting glance, While vermeil dyed the mulberry; thus I turn'd To my sage guide, relenting, when I heard The name that springs forever in my breast. He shook his forehead; and, “How long,” he said, “Linger we now?” then smiled, as one would smile Upon a child that eyes the fruit and yields. Into the fire before me then he walk’d; And Statius, who erewhile no little space Had parted us, he pray’d to come behind.

The sire beloved, To comfort me, as he proceeded, still Of Beatrice talk’d. “Her eyes,” saith he, “E’en now I seem to view.” From the other side A voice, that sang, did guide us; and the voice Following, with heedful ear, we issued forth, There where the path led upward. “Come,” * we heard, “Come, blessed of my Father.” Such the sounds, That hail’d us from within a light, which shone So radiant, I could not endure the view. “The sun,” it added, “hastes: and evening comes.

When we had run O’er all the ladder to its topmost round, As there we stood, on me the Mantuan fix’d His eyes, and thus he spake: “Both fires, my son, The temporal and eternal, thou hast seen; And art arrived, where of itself my ken No further reaches.

He speaks to her; and she, in reply, explains to him certain things touching the nature of that place, and tells that the water, which flows between them, is here called Lethe, and in another place has the name of Eunoe.

Thus they to different havens are moved on Through the vast sea of being, and each one With instinct given, that bears it in its course: This to the lunar sphere directs the fire; This moves the hearts of mortal animals; This the brute earth together knits, and binds.

There will! be seen That, which we hold through faith; not shown by proof, But in itself intelligibly plain, E’en as the truth that man at first believes. I answer’d: “Lady! I with thoughts devout, Such as I best can frame, give thanks to Him, Who hath removed me from the mortal world. But tell, I pray thee, whence the gloomy spots Upon this body, which below on earth Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?” She somewhat smiled, then spake: “If mortals err In their opinion, when the key of sense Unlocks not, surely wonder’s weapon keen Ought not to pierce thee: since thou find’st, the wings Of reason to pursue the senses’ flight Are short. But what thy own thought is, declare.” Then I: “What various here above appears, Is caused, I deem, by bodies dense or rare.” She then resumed: “Thou certainly wilt see In falsehood thy belief o’erwhelm’d, if well Thou listen to the arguments which I Shall bring to face it. The eighth sphere displays Numberless lights, the which, in kind and size, May be remark'd of different aspects: If rare or dense of that were cause alone, One single virtue then would be in all; Alike distributed, or more, or less. Different virtues needs must be the fruits Of formal principles; and these, save one,

CANTO II PARADISE Will by thy reasoning be destroy’d. Beside, If rarity were of that dusk the cause, Which thou inquirest, either in some part That planet must throughout be void, nor fed With its own matter; or, as bodies share Their fat and leanness, in like manner this Must in its volume change the leaves.? The first, If it were true, had through the sun’s eclipse Been manifested, by transparency Of light, as through aught rare beside effused. But this is not. Therefore remains to see The other cause: and, if the other fall, Erroneous so must prove what seem’d to thee. If not from side to side this rarity Pass through, there needs must be a limit, whence Its contrary no further lets it pass. And hence the beam, that from without proceeds, Must be pour’d back; as colour comes, through glass Reflected, which behind it lead conceals. Now wilt thou say, that there of murkier hue, Than, in the other part, the ray is shown, By being thence refracted farther back.

Three mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove From thee alike; and more remote the third, Betwixt the former pair, shall meet thine eyes: Then turn’d toward them, cause behind thy back A light to stand, that on the three shall shine, And thus reflected come to thee from all. Though that, beheld most distant, do not stretch A space so ample, yet in brightness thou Wilt own it equaling the rest. But now, As under snow the ground, if the warm ray Smites it, remains dismantled of the hue And cold, that cover’d it before; so thee, Dismantled in thy mind, I will inform 291 2 “Change the leaves.” Would, like leaves of parchment, be darker in some parts than in others.

The other orbs Their separate distinctions variously Dispose, for their own seed and produce apt. Thus do these organs of the world proceed, As thou beholdest now, from step to step; Their influences from above deriving, And thence transmitting downward. Mark me well; How through this passage to the truth I ford, The truth thou lovest; that thou henceforth, alone, Mayst know to keep the shallows, safe, untold. “The virtue and motion of the sacred orbs, As mallet by the workman’s hand, must needs By blessed movers‘ be inspired. This Heaven,® Made beauteous by so many luminaries, From the deep spirit,® that moves its circling sphere, Its image takes and impress as a seal: And as the soul, that dwells within your dust, Through members different, yet together form’d, In different powers resolves itself; e’en so The intellectual efficacy unfolds Its goodness multiplied throughout the stars; On its own unity revolving still.

As through translucent and smooth glass, or wave Clear and unmoved, and flowing not so deep As that its bed is dark, the shape returns So faint of our impictured lineaments, That, on white forehead set, a pearl as strong Comes to the eye; such saw I many a face, All stretch’d to speak; from whence I straight conceived, Delusion? opposite to that, which raised, Between the man and fountain, amorous flame.

But speak thou with them; listen, and believe, That the true light, which fills them with desire, Permits not from its beams their feet to stray.” Straight to the shadow, which for converse seem’d Most earnest, I address’d me; and began As one by over-eagerness perplex’d: “O spirit, born for joy! who in the rays Of life eternal, of that sweetness know’st The flavour, which, not tasted, passes far All apprehension; me it well would please, If thou wouldst tell me of thy name, and this Your station here.” Whence she with kindness prompt And eyes glist’ring with smiles: “Our charity, To any wish by justice introduced, Bars not the door; no more than She above, Who would have all her court be like herself. I was a virgin sister in the earth; And if thy mind observe me well, this form, With such addition graced of loveliness, Will not conceal me long; but thou wilt know Piccarda,’ in the tardiest sphere thus placed, Here ’mid these other blessed also blest. Our hearts, whose high affections burn alone With pleasure from the Holy Spirit conceived, Admitted to His order, dwell in joy. And this condition, which appears so low, Is for this cause assign’d us, that our vows Were, in some part, neglected and made void.” Whence I to her replied: “Something divine Beams in your countenances wondrous fair; From former knowledge quite transmuting you. 3“Piccarda.” The sister of Corso Petrarch has been supposed to allude to Donati, and of Forese, whom we have this lady in his “Triumph of Chastity,” seen in the Purgatory, Canto xxiv. v. 160, etc.

Yet inform me, ye, who here Are happy; long ye for a higher place, More to behold, and more in love to dwell?” She with those other spirits gently smiled; Then answer’d with such gladness, that she seem’d With love’s first flame to glow: “Brother! our will Is, in composure, settled by the power Of charity, who makes us will alone What we possess, and naught beyond desire: If we should wish to be exalted more, Then must our wishes jar with the high will Of Him, who sets us here; which in these orbs Thou wilt confess not possible, if here To be in charity must needs befall, And if her nature well thou contemplate. Rather it is inherent in this state Of blessedness, to keep ourselves within The Divine Will, by which our wills with His Are one. So that as we, from step to step, Are placed throughout this kingdom, pleases all, Even as our King, who in us plants His will; And in His will is our tranquillity: It is the mighty ocean, whither tends Whatever it creates and Nature makes.” Then saw I clearly how each spot in Heaven ‘+ Paradise, though with like gracious dew The supreme virtue shower not over all.

Before the spouse of Christ came together with her new husband, she knelt down before a crucifix and recommended her virginity to Christ. Soon after her whole body was smitten with leprosy; in a few days, through the divine disposal, she passed with a palm of virginity to the Lord. 7 Daughter of Ruggieri, King of Sicily, who being taken by force out of a monastery was married to the Emperor Henry VI and by him was mother of Frederick II. She was fifty years old or more at the time, and “because it was not credited that she could have a child at that age, she was delivered in a pavilion, and it was given out that any lady, who pleased, was at liberty to see her.” 8 Henry VI, son of Frederick I, was the second emperor of the house of Suabia; oe his son Frederick II “the third and ast.”

He inquires whether it is possible to make satisfaction for a vow broken. ETWEEN two kinds of food, both equally Remote and tempting, first a man might die Of hunger, ere he one could freely chuse. E’en so would stand a lamb between the maw Of two fierce wolves, in dread of both alike: E’en so between two deer a dog would stand. Wherefore, if I was silent, fault nor praise I to myself impute; by equal doubts Held in suspense; since of necessity It happen’d. Silent was I, yet desire Was painted in my looks; and thus I spake My wish more earnestly than language could. As Daniel,’ when the haughty king he freed From ire, that spurr’d him on to deeds unjust And violent; so did Beatrice then. “Well I discern,” she thus her words address’d, “How thou art drawn by each of these desires;?

I have, no doubt, instill’d into thy mind, That blessed spirit may not lie; since near The source of primal truth it dwells for aye: And thou mightst after of Piccarda learn That Constance held affection to the veil; So that she seems to contradict me here. Not seldom, brother, it hath chanced for men To do what they had gladly left undone; Yet, to shun peril, they have done amiss: E’en as Alcmzon, at his father’s! suit Slew his own mother;'? so made pitiless, Not to lose pity. On this point bethink thee, That force and will are blended in such wise As not to make the offence excusable. Absolute will agrees not to the wrong; But inasmuch as there is fear of woe From non-compliance, it agrees. Of will? Thus absolute, Piccarda spake, and I Of the other; so that both have truly said.” Such was the flow of that pure rill, that well’d From forth the fountain of all truth; and such The rest, that to my wandering thoughts I found. “O thou, of primal love the prime delight, Goddess!” | straight replied, “whose lively words Still shed new heat and vigour through my soul; Affection fails me to requite thy grace With equal sum of gratitude: be His To recompense, who sees and can reward thee.

CANTO V 301 AxcuMENT.—The question proposed in the last Canto is answered. Dante ascends with Beatrice to the planet Mercury, which is the second heaven; and here he finds a multitude of spirits, one of whom offers to satisfy him of anything he may desire to know from them. 1“T£ beyond earthly wont.” Dante having been unable to sustain the splendor WU F beyond earthly wont,! the flame of love Illume me, so that I o’ercome thy power Of vision, marvel not: but learn the cause In that perfection of the sight, which, soon As apprehending, hasteneth on to reach The good it apprehends.

Hence now thou mayst infer Of what high worth the vow, which so is framed That when man offers, God well-pleased accepts: For in the compact between God and him, This treasure, such as I describe it to thee, He makes the victim; and of his own act. What compensation therefore may he find? CANTO V If that, whereof thou hast oblation made, By using well thou think’st to consecrate, Thou wouldst of theft do charitable deed. Thus I resolve thee of the greater point. “But forasmuch as holy Church, herein Dispensing, seems to contradict the truth I have discover’d to thee, yet behoves Thou rest a little longer at the board, Ere the crude aliment which thou hast ta’en, Digested fitly, to nutrition turn. Open thy mind to what I now unfold; And give it inward keeping. Knowledge comes Of learning well retain’d, unfruitful else. “This sacrifice, in essence, of two things Consisteth: one is that, whereof ’tis made; The covenant, the other?

But if the judgment be moved by the appetite in any way preventing it, it cannot be free: because it acts not of itself, but is led captive by another. And hence it is that brutes cannot have free judgment, because their judgments are always prevented by appetite. And hence it may also appear manifest that intellectual substances, whose wills are immutable, and likewise souls separated from the body, and departing from it well and holily, lose not the liberty of choice on account of the immutability of the will, but retain it most perfectly and powerfully. This being discerned, it is again plain that this liberty, or principle of all our liberty, is the greatest good conferred on human nature by God; because by this very thing we are here made happy, as men; by this we are elsewhere happy, as divine beings.” 3 The one, the substance of the vow, as of a single life, or of keeping fast; the other, the compact.

No satisfaction therefore can be paid For what so precious in the balance weighs, That all in counterpoise must kick the beam. Take then no vow at random: ta’en, with faith Preserve it; yet not bent, as Jephthah once, Blindly to execute a rash resolve, Whom better it had suited to exclaim, ‘I have done ill,’ than to redeem his pledge By doing worse: or, not unlike to him In folly, that great leader of the Greeks; Whence, on the altar, Iphigenia mourn’d Her virgin beauty, and hath since made mourn Both wise and simple, even all, who hear Of so fell sacrifice.

Though mainly prompt new question to propose, Her silence and changed look did keep me dumb. And as the arrow, ere the cord is still, Leapeth unto its mark; so on we sped Into the second realm. There I beheld The dame, so joyous, enter, that the orb Grew brighter at her smiles; and, if the star Were moved to gladness, what then was my cheer, Whom nature hath made apt for every change! As in a quiet and clear lake the fish, If aught approach them from without, do draw Toward it, deeming it their food; so drew Full more than thousand splendours toward us; And in each one was heard: “Lo! one arrived To multiply our loves!” and as each came, The shadow, streaming forth effulgence new, Witness’d augmented joy. Here, Reader! think, If thou didst miss the sequel of my tale, To know the rest how sorely thou wouldst crave; And thou shalt see what vehement desire Possess’d me, soon as these had met my view, To know their state. “O born in happy hour! Thou, to whom grace vouchsafes, or e’er thy close Of fleshly warfare, to behold the thrones Of that eternal triumph; know, to us The light communicated, which through Heaven Expatiates without bound. Therefore, if aught Thou of our beams wouldst borrow for thine aid, Spare not; and, of our radiance, take thy fill.” Thus of those piteous spirits one bespake me; And Beatrice next: “Say on; and trust As unto gods.”—“How in the light supreme Thou harbour’st, and from thence the virtue bring’st, That, sparkling in thine eyes, denotes thy joy, I mark; but, who thou art, am still to seek; Or wherefore, worthy spirit! for thy lot

These difficulties are fully explained by Beatrice. * OSANNA!

Not long that mood Beatrice suffer’d: she, with such a smile, As might have made one blest amid the flames,? Beaming upon me, thus her words began: “Thou in thy thought art pondering (as I deem, And what I deem is truth) how just revenge Could be with justice punish’d: from which doubt I soon will free thee; so thou mark my words; For they of weighty matter shall possess thee.

Contemplate here the wonder I unfold: The nature with its Maker thus conjoin’d, Created first was blameless, pure and good; But, through itself alone, was driven forth From Paradise, because it had eschew’d The way of truth and life, to evil turn’d.

What distils Immediate thence, no end of being knows; Bearing its seal immutably imprest. Whatever thence immediate falls, is free, Free wholly, uncontrollable by power Of each thing new: by such conformity More grateful to its Author, whose bright beams, Though all partake their shining, yet in those Are liveliest, which resemble Him the most. These tokens of pre-eminence’ on man Largely bestow’d, if any of them fail, He needs must forfeit his nobility, No longer stainless. Sin alone is that, Which doth disfranchise him, and make unlike To the Chief Good; for that its light in him Is darken’d. And to dignity thus lost Is no return; unless, where guilt makes void, He for ill pleasure pay with equal pain. Your nature, which entirely in its seed Transgress'd, from these distinctions fell, no less Than from its state in Paradise; nor means Found of recovery (search all methods out As strictly as thou may) save one of these, The only fords were left through which to wade: Either, that God had of His courtesy Released him merely; or else, man himself For his own folly by himself atoned. “Fix now thine eye, intently as thou canst, On the everlasting counsel; and explore, Instructed by my words, the dread abyss. “Man in himself had ever lack’d the means Of satisfaction, for he could not stoop Obeying, in humility so low, As high, he, disobeying, thought to soar: TThe before-mentioned gifts of im- similitude and agreeableness to the Divine mediate creation by God, independence Being, all at first conferred on man. on secondary causes, and consequent

Then behoved That God should by His own ways lead him back Unto the life, from whence he fell, restored; By both His ways, I mean, or one alone.’ But since the deed is ever prized the more, The more the doer’s good intent appears; Goodness celestial, whose broad signature Is on the universe, of all its ways To raise ye up, was fain to leave out none. Nor aught so vast or so magnificent, Either for Him who gave or who received, Between the last night and the primal day, Was or can be. For God more bounty show’d, Giving Himself to make man capable Of his return to life, than had the terms Been mere and unconditional release.

But the elements, Which thou hast named, and what of them is made, Are by created virtue inform’d: create, Their substance; and create, the informing virtue In these bright stars, that round them circling move.

But this our life the Eternal Good inspires Immediate, and enamours of itself; So that our wishes rest for ever here. “And hence thou mayst by inference conclude Our resurrection certain, if thy mind Consider how the human flesh was framed, When both our parents at the first were made.” CANTO VIII unfolds the cause why children differ in disposition from their parents. 1The Poet, on his arrival at the third Heaven, tells us that the world, in its days of heathen darkness, believed the HE world! was, iu its day of peril dark, Wont to believe the dotage of fond love, From the fair Cyprian deity, who rolls In her third epicycle, shed on men By stream of potent radiance: therefore they Of elder time, in their old error blind, Not her alone with sacrifice adored And invocation, but like honours paid To Cupid and Dione, deem’d of them Her mother, and her son, him whom they feign’d To sit in Dido’s bosom: and from her, Whom I have sung preluding, borrow’d they The appellation of that star, which views influence of sensual love to proceed from Cupid. the star, to which, under the name of Venus, they paid divine honors; as they worshipped the supposed mother and son of Venus, under the names of Dione and

I was not ware that I was wafted up Into its orb; but the new loveliness, That graced my lady, gave me ample proof That we had enter’d there. And as in flame A sparkle is distinct, or voice in voice Discern’d, when one its even tenour keeps, The other comes and goes; so in that light I other luminaries saw, that coursed In circling motion, rapid more or less, As their eternal vision each impels. Never was blast from vapour charged with cold, Whether invisible to eye or no, Descended with such speed, it had not seem’d To linger in dull tardiness, compared To those celestial lights, that toward us came, Leaving the circuit of their joyous ring, Conducted by the lofty Seraphim. And after them, who in the van appear’d, Such an Hosanna sounded as hath left Desire, ne’er since extinct in me, to hear Renew’d the strain. Then, parting from the rest, One near us drew, and sole began: “We all Are ready at thy pleasure, well disposed To do thee gentle service. We are they To whom thou in the world erewhile didst sing; ‘O ye! whose intellectual ministry Moves the third Heaven:’ and in one orb we roll, One motion, one impulse, with those who rule Princedoms in Heaven; yet are of love so full, That to please thee twill be as sweet to rest.” After mine eyes had with meek reverence Sought the celestial guide, and were by her Assured, they turn’d again unto the light, Who had so largely promised; and with voice That bare the lively pressure of my zeal, “Tell who ye are,” I cried. Forthwith it grew In size and splendour, through augmented joy; And thus it answer’d: ‘“‘A short date, below,

The evil, that would have been prevented by the longer life of Charles Martel, was that resistance which his brother Robert, King of Sicily, who succeeded him, made to the Emperor Henry VII. 3Charles Martel might have been known to our Poet at Florence, whither he came to meet his father in 1259, the year of his death. G. Villani says that “he remained more than twenty days in Florence, waiting for his father, King Charles, and his brothers.”” Lib. vii. cap. xiii, His brother Robert, King of Naples, was the friend of Petrarch. 4“The left bank.” Provence. 5 The kingdom of Naples. §“The land.” Hungary. 7 Sicily; so called from its three promontories of which Pachynus and Pelorus, here mentioned, are two. 8The giant, whom Jupiter overwhelmed under Mount tna, whence he vomited forth smoke and flame. 8 "Sicily would be still ruled by monarchs, descended through me_ from Charles I and Rodolph I, the former my grandfather, King of Naples and Sicily; the latter, Emperor of Germany, my father-in-law;"” both celebrated in the “Purgatory,” Canto vii. 10Tf the ill-conduct of our governors in Sicily had not excited the people to that dreadful massacre at the Sicilian vespers

Had but my brother’s foresight’? kenn'd as much, He had been warier, that the greedy want Of Catalonia might not work his bale. And truly need there is that he forecast, Or other for him, lest more freight be laid On his already over-laden bark. Nature in him, from bounty fallen to thrift, Would ask the guard of braver arms, than such As only care to have their coffers fill’d.” “My liege! it doth enhance the joy thy words Infuse into me, mighty as it is, To think my gladness manifest to thee, As to myself, who own it, when thou look’st Into the source and limit of all good, There, where thou markest that which thou dost speak, Thence prized of me the more. Glad thou hast made Now make intelligent, clearing the doubt [me: Thy speech hath raised in me; for much I muse, How bitter can spring up,'? when sweet is sown.” I thus inquiring; he forthwith replied: “If I have power to show one truth, soon that Shall face thee, which thy questioning declares Behind thee now conceal’d.

The Supreme Being uses these spheres as the intelligent instruments of His providence in the conduct of terrestrial natures; so that these natures cannot but be conducted aright. unless these heavenly bodies should themselves fail from not having becn made perfect at first, or the Creator of them should fail. To this Dante replies, that Nature, he is satisfied, thus directed must do her part. Charles Martel then reminds him that he had learned from Aristotle that human society requires a variety of conditions, and consequently a variety of qualifications in its members. Accordingly, men are born with different powers and capacities, caused by the influence of the heavenly bodies at the time of their nativity; on which influence, and not on their parents, those powers and capacities depend. Charles Martel adds, by way of corollary, that the want of observing their natural bent. in the destination of men to their several offices in life, is the occasion of much of the disorder that prevails in the world.

318 THE DIVINE COMEDY CANTO VIII And blessed makes this realm which thou dost mount, Ordains its providence to be the virtue In these great bodies: nor the natures only The all-perfect Mind provides for, but with them That which preserves them too; for naught, that lies Within the range of that unerring bow, But is as level with the destined aim, As ever mark to arrow's point opposed. Were it not thus, these Heavens, thou dost visit, Would their effect so work, it would not be Art, but destruction; and this may not chance, If the intellectual powers, that move these stars, Fail not, and who, first faulty made them, fail. Wilt thou this truth more clearly evidenced?” To whom I thus: “It is enough: no fear, I see, lest nature in her part should tire.” He straight rejoin’d: “Say, were it worse for man, If he lived not in fellowship on earth?” “Yea,” answer’d IJ; “nor here a reason needs.” “And may that be, if different estates Grow not of different duties in your life? Consult your teacher," and he tells you ‘no.’” Thus did he come, deducing to this point, And then concluded: “For this cause behoves, The roots, from whence your operations come, Must differ. Therefore one is Solon born; Another, Xerxes; and Melchisedec A third; and he a fourth, whose airy voyage Cost him his son.5 In her circuitous course, Nature, that is the seal to mortal wax, Doth well her art, but no distinction owns *Twixt one or other household.

Thus place I in thy sight That, which was late behind thee. But, in sign Of more affection for thee, ’tis my will Thou wear this corollary.

See v. 70. 5 Between Rialto in the Venetian territory, and the sources of the rivers Brenta and Piava, is situated a castle called Romano, the birthplace of the famous tyrant Ezzolino or Azzolino, the brother of Cunizza, who is now speaking. See Hell, Canto xii. v. 110. 6 “Cunizza.” The adventures of Cunizza, overcome by the influence of her star, are related by the chronicler Rolandino, of Padua. She eloped from her first husband, Richard of St. Boniface, in the company of Sordello, with whom she is supposed to have cohabited before her marriage: then lived with a soldier of Trevigt, whose wife was living at the same time in the same city; and, on his being murdered by her brother the tyrant, was by her brother married to a nobleman of Braganzo: lastly, when he also had fallen by the same hand, she after her brother's death, was again wedded in Verona. ™ I am not dissatisfied that I am not allotted a higher place.” 8“This.”” Folco of Genoa, a celebrated Provencal poet, commonly termed Folques of Marseilles, of which place he was perhaps bishop.

He then taught theology in various parts of Germany, and particularly at Cologne. Thomas Aquinas was his favorite pupil. In 1260 he reluctantly accepted the bishopric of Ratisbon, and in two years after resigned it, and returned to his cell in Cologne, where the remainder of his life was passed in superintending the school, and in composing his voluminous works on divinity and natural science. He died in 1280. 16 Thomas Aquinas, of whom Bucer is reported to have said, “Take but Thomas away, and I will overturn the Church of Rome”; and whom Hooker terms “the greatest among the school divines"— (Eccl.

Whoso laments, that we must doff this garb Of frail mortality, thenceforth to live Immortally above; he hath not seen The sweet refreshing of that heavenly shower?

Our shape, regarmented with glorious weeds Of saintly flesh, must, being thus entire, Show yet more gracious. Therefore shall increase Whate’er, of light, gratuitous imparts The Supreme Good; light, ministering aid, The better to disclose His glory: whence, The vision needs increasing, must increase The fervour, which it kindles; and that too The ray, that comes from it. But as the gleed Which gives out flame, yet in its whiteness shines More livelily than that, and so preserves Its proper semblance; thus this circling sphere Of splendour shall to view less radiant seem, Than shall our fleshly robe, which yonder earth Now covers. Nor will such excess of light O’erpower us, in corporeal organs made Firm, and susceptible of all delight.” So ready and so cordial an “Amen” Follow’d from either choir, as plainly spoke Desire of their dead bodies; yet perchance Not for themselves, but for their kindred dear, Mothers and sires, and those whom best they loved, Ere they were made imperishable flame.

Yet I mark’d it was a hymn Of lofty praises; for there came to me “Arise,” and “Conquer,” as to one who hears And comprehends not. Me such ecstasy O’ercame, that never, till that hour, was thing That held me in so sweet imprisonment. Perhaps my saying overbold appears, Accounting less the pleasure of those eyes, Whereon to look fulfilleth all desire. But he, who is aware those living seals Of every beauty work with quicker force, The higher they are risen; and that there I had not turn’d me to them; he may well Excuse me that, whereof in my excuse I do accuse me, and may own my truth; That holy pleasure here not yet reveal’d, Which grows in transport as we mount aloof.

So forward stretch’d him (if of credence aught Our greater muse may claim) the pious ghost Of old Anchises, in the Elysian bower, When he perceived his son. “O thou, my blood! O most exceeding grace divine! to whom, As now to thee, hath twice the heavenly gate Been e’er unclosed?” So spake the light: whence I Turn’d me toward him; then unto my dame My sight directed: and on either side Amazement waited me; for in her eyes Was lighted such a smile, I thought that mine Had dived unto the bottom of my grace And of my bliss in Paradise. Forthwith, To hearing and to sight grateful alike, The spirit to his proem added things I understood not, so profound he spake: Yet not of choice, but through necessity, Mysterious; for his high conception soar’d Beyond the mark of mortals. When the flight Of holy transport had so spent its rage, That nearer to the level of our thought The speech descended; the first sounds I heard Were, “Blest be thou, Triunal Deity! That hast such favour in my seed vouchsafed.” Then follow’d. “No unpleasant thirst, though long, Which took me reading in the sacred book, Whose leaves or white or dusky never change, Thou hast allay’d, my son! within this light,

But, that the love, which keeps me wakeful ever, Urging with sacred thirst of sweet desire, May be contented fully; let thy voice, Fearless, and frank, and jocund, utter forth Thy will distinctly, utter forth the wish, Whereto my ready answer stands decreed.” I turn’d me to Beatrice; and she heard Ere I had spoken, smiling an assent, That to my will gave wings; and I began: “To each among your tribe, what time ye kenn’d The nature, in whom naught unequal dwells, Wisdom and love were in one measure dealt; For that they are so equal in the Sun, From whence ye drew your radiance and your heat, As makes all likeness scant.

The Canto concludes with an invective against the avarice of the clergy, and especially of the pope.

Thus much Yet may I speak; that, as I gazed on her, Affection found no room for other wish. While the everlasting pleasure, that did full On Beatrice shine, with second view From her fair countenance my gladden’d soul Contented; vanquishing me with a beam Of her soft smile, she spake: “Turn thee, and list.

I saw, Within that Jovial cresset, the clear sparks Of love, that reign’d there, fashion to my view Our language. And as birds, from river banks Arisen, now in round, now lengthen’d troop, Array them in their flight, greeting, as seems, Their new-found pastures; so, within the lights, The saintly creatures flying, sang; and made Now D, now I, now L, figured i’ the air.

It then solves a doubt, which our Poet had entertained, respecting the possibility of salvation without belief in Christ; exposes the inefficacy of a mere profession of such belief; and prophesies the evil appearance that many Christian potentates will CANTO XIX make at the day of judgment. “To him.” was stamped with the impression of John EFORE my sight appear’d, with open wings, The beauteous image; in fruition sweet, Gladdening the thronged spirits.

Where is the justice that condemns him? where His blame, if he believeth not?’—What then, And who art thou, that on the stool wouldst sit To judge at distance of a thousand miles With the short-sighted vision of a span? To him, who subtilizes thus with me, There would assuredly be room for doubt Even to wonder, did not the safe word Of Scripture hold supreme authority. “O animals of clay! O spirits gross! The Primal Will,' that in itself is good, Hath from itself, the chief Good, ne’er been moved. Justice consists in consonance with it, Derivable by no created good, Whose very cause depends upon its beam.” As on her nest the stork, that turns about Unto her young, whom lately she hath fed, Whiles they with upward eyes do look on her; So lifted I my gaze; and, bending so, The ever-blessed image waved its wings, Labouring with such deep counsel. Wheeling round It warbled, and did say: “As are my notes To thee, who understand’st them not; such is The eternal judgment unto mortal ken.” Then still abiding in that ensign ranged, Wherewith the Romans overawed the world, Those burning splendours of the Holy Spirit Took up the strain; and thus it spake again: “None ever hath ascended to this realm, Who hath not a believer been in Christ, Either before or after the blest limbs Were nail’d upon the wood.

370 THE DIVINE COMEDY CANTO XxX CANTO XX ARcuUMENT.—The eagle celebrates the praise of certain kings, whose glorified spirits form the eye of the bird. In the pupil is David; and, in the circle round it, Trajan, Hezekiah, Constantine, William II of Sicily, and Ripheus.

The eye was kindled; and the blessed sign, No more to keep me wondering and suspense, Replied: “I see that thou believest these things, Because I tell them, but discern’st not how; So that thy knowledge waits not on thy faith: As one, who knows the name of thing by rote, But is a stranger to its properties, Till other’s tongue reveal them.

The other, through the riches of that grace, Which from so deep a fountain doth distil, As never eye created saw its rising, Placed all his love below on just and right: Wherefore, of grace, God oped in him the eye To the redemption of mankind to come; Wherein believing, he endured no more The filth of Paganism, and for their ways Rebuked the stubborn nations.

Here are the souls of those who had passed their life in holy retirement and contemplation. Piero Damiano comes near them, and answers questions put to him by Dante; then declares who he was on earth; and ends by declaiming against the luxury of pastors and prelates in those times. GAIN mine eyes were fix’d on Beatrice; And, with mine eyes, my soul that in her looks Found all contentment. Yet no smile she wore: And, “Did I smile,” quoth she, “thou wouldst be straight Like Semele when into ashes turn’d; For, mounting these eternal palace-stairs, My beauty, which the loftier it climbs, As thou hast noted, still doth kindle more, So shines, that, were no tempering interposed, Thy mortal puissance would from its rays Shrink, as the leaf doth from the thunderbolt.

And one, lingering near us, wax’d So bright, that in my thought I said: “The love, Which this betokens me, admits no doubt.” Unwillingly from question I refrain; To her, by whom my silence and my speech Are order’d, looking for a sign: whence she, Who in the sight of Him, that seeth all, Saw wherefore I was silent, prompted me To indulge the fervent wish; and I began: “I am not worthy, of my own desert, That thou shouldst answer me: but for her sake, Who hath vouchsafed my asking, spirit blest, That in thy joy art shrouded! say the cause, Which bringeth thee so near: and wherefore, say, Doth the sweet symphony of Paradise Keep silence here, pervading with such sounds Of rapt devotion every lower sphere?” “Mortal art thou in hearing, as in sight;” Was the reply: “and what forbade the smile?

He was employed in several important missions, and rewarded by Stephen IX with the dignity of cardinal, and the bishopric of Ostia, to which, however, he preferred his former retreat in the monastery of Fonte Avellana, and prevailed on Alexander II to permit him to retire thither. Yet he did not long continue in this seclusion, before he was sent on other embassies. He died at Faenza in 1072. His letters throw much light on the obscure history of these times. Besides them, he has left several treatises on sacred and ec clesiastical subjects. His eloquence is worthy of a better age.” Tiraboschi, Storia della Lett.

E’en as set down by the unerring style Of thy dear brother, who with thee conspired To bring Rome in unto the way of life, Faith of things hoped is substance, and the proof Of things not seen; and herein doth consist Methinks its essence.”—"“Rightly hast thou deem’d,” Was answer’d; “if thou well discern, why first He hath defined it substance, and then proof.” “The deep things,” I replied, “which here I scan Distinctly, are below from mortal eye So hidden, they have in belief alone Their being; on which credence, hope sublime Is built: and, therefore substance, it intends. And inasmuch as we must needs infer

But tell me, if thou hast it in thy purse.” “Even so glittering and so round,” said I, “T not a whit misdoubt of its assay.” Next issued from the deep-imbosom’d splendour: “Say, whence the costly jewel, on the which Is founded every virtue, came to thee.” “The flood,” I answer’d, “from the Spirit of God Rain’d down upon the ancient bond and new,'— Here is the reasoning that convinceth me So feelingly, each argument beside Seems blunt and forceless in comparison.” Then heard I: “Wherefore holdest thou that each, The elder proposition and the new, Which so persuade thee, are the voice of Heaven?” “The works, that follow’d, evidence their truth,” I answer'd: “Nature did not make for these The iron hot, or on her anvil mould them.” “Who voucheth to thee of the works themselves,” Was the reply, “that they in very deed Are that they purport? None hath sworn so to thee.” “That all the world,” said I, “should have been turn’d To Christian, and no miracle been wrought, Would in itself be such a miracle, The rest were not an hundredth part so great. E’en thou went’st forth in poverty and hunger To set the goodly plant, that, from the vine It once was, now is grown unsightly bramble.” That ended, through the high celestial court Resounded all the spheres, “Praise we one God!” 1“The ancient bond and new.” The Old and New Testaments.

Behoves thee to express, what thou believest, The next; and, whereon, thy belief hath grown.” “O saintly sire and spirit!” I began, “Who seest that, which thou didst so believe, As to outstrip feet younger than thine own, Toward the sepulchre; thy will is here, That I the tenour of my creed unfold; And thou, the cause of it, hast likewise ask’d. And I reply: I in one God believe; One sole eternal Godhead, of whose love All Heaven is moved, Himself unmoved the while. Nor demonstration physical alone, Or more intelligential and abstruse, Persuades me to this faith: but from that truth It cometh to me rather, which is shed Through Moses; the rapt Prophets; and the Psalms; The Gospel; and what ye yourselves did write, When ye were gifted of the Holy Ghost. In three eternal Persons I believe; Essence threefold and one; mysterious league Of union absolute, which, many a time, The word of gospel lore upon my mind Imprints: and from this germ, this firstling spark The lively flame dilates; and, like Heaven's star, Doth glitter in me.” As the master hears, Well pleased, and then enfoldeth in his arms The servant, who hath joyful tidings brought, And having told the errand keeps his peace; Thus benediction uttering with song, Soon as my peace I held, compass’d me thrice 2“Quel Baron.” In the next Canto, Boccaccio, G. vi.

Many others were deterred by the difhculty of the journey, by the roughness and barrenness of those parts, and by the incursions of the Moors, who made capdives many of the pilgrims. The canons of St. Eloy, afterward (the precise time is not known), with a desire of remedying these evils, built, in many places along the whole road, which reached as far as to France, hospitals for the reception of the pilgrims.”

For well thou know’st, who figurest it as oft, As Jesus, to ye three, more brightly shone.” “Lift up thy head; and be thou strong in trust: For that, which hither from the mortal world Arriveth, must be ripen’d in our beam.” Such cheering accents from the second flame® Assured me; and mine eyes I lifted up’ Unto the mountains, that had bow’d them late With over-heavy burden. “Sith our Liege Wills of His grace, that thou, or e’er thy death, In the most secret council with His lords Shouldst be confronted, so that having view’d The glories of our court, thou mayest therewith Thyself, and all who hear, invigorate With hope, that leads to blissful end; declare, What is that hope? how it doth flourish in thee?

Like as a virgin riseth up, and goes, And enters on the mazes of the dance; Though gay, yet innocent of worse intent, Than to do fitting honour to the bride: So I beheld the new effulgence come Unto the other two, who in a ring Wheel’d, as became their rapture. In the dance, And in the song, it mingled. And the dame Held on them fix’d her looks; e’en as the spouse, Silent, and moveless. “This'* is he, who lay Upon the bosom of our Pelican: This he, into whose keeping, from the Cross, The mighty charge was given.” Thus she spake: Yet therefore naught the more removed her sight From marking them: or e’er her words began, Or when they closed.

The essence then, where such advantage is, That each good, found without it, is naught else But of His light the beam, must needs attract The soul of each one, loving, who the truth Discerns, on which this proof is built.

And as a sleep is broken and dispersed Through sharp encounter of the nimble light, With the eye’s spirit running forth to meet The ray, from membrane on to membrane urged; And the upstartled wight loathes that he sees; So, at his sudden waking, he misdeems Of all around him, till assurance waits On better judgment: thus the saintly dame Drove from before mine eyes the motes away, With the resplendence of her own, that cast Their brightness downward, thousand miles below. Whence I my vision, clearer than before, Recover’d; and well nigh astounded, ask’d Of a fourth light, that now with us I saw. And Beatrice: “The first living soul,® That ever the first Virtue framed, admires Within these rays his Maker.” Like the leaf, That bows its lithe top till the blast is blown; By its own virtue rear’d, then stands aloof: So I, the whilst she said, awe-stricken bow’d. Then eagerness to speak embolden’d me; And I began: “O fruit! that wast alone Mature, when first engender’d; ancient father! That doubly seest in every wedded bride Thy daughter, by affinity and blood; Devoutly as I may, I pray thee hold Converse with me: my will thou seest: and I, More speedily to hear thee, tell it not.” It chanceth oft some animal bewrays, Through the sleek covering of his furry coat, «“The leaves.” Created beings. 8 “The first living soul.” Adam

HEN “Glory to the Father, to the Son, And to the Holy Spirit,” rang aloud Throughout all Paradise; that with the song My spirit reel’d, so passing sweet the strain. And what I saw was equal ecstasy: One universal smile it seem’d of all things; Joy past compare; gladness unutterable; Imperishable life of peace and love; Exhaustless riches, and unmeasured bliss. Before mine eyes stood the four torches’ lit: And that,? which first had come, began to wax In brightness; and, in semblance, such became, As Jove might be, if he and Mars were birds, And interchanged their plumes. Silence ensued, Through the blest quire; by Him, who here appoints Vicissitude of ministry, enjoin’d; When thus I heard: “Wonder not, if my hue Be changed; for, while I speak, these shalt thou see All in like manner change with me.

Its boon influence From the fair nest of Leda’ rapt me forth, And wafted on into the swiftest Heaven. What place for entrance Beatrice chose, I may not say; so uniform was all, Liveliest and loftiest. She my secret wish Divined; and, with such gladness, that God’s love Seem’d from her visage shining, thus began: “Here is the goal, whence motion on his race Starts: motionless the centre, and the rest All moved around. Except the soul divine, Place in this Heaven is none; the soul divine, Wherein the love, which ruleth o’er its orb, Is kindled, and the virtue, that it sheds: One circle, light and love, enclasping it, As this doth clasp the others; and to Him, Who draws the bound, its limit only known. Measured itself by none, it doth divide Motion to all, counted unto them forth, As by the fifth or half ye count forth ten. The vase, wherein time’s roots are plunged, thou seest: Look elsewhere for the leaves. O mortal lust! That canst not lift thy head above the waves Which whelm and sink thee down. The will in man Bears goodly blossoms; but its ruddy promise Is, by the dripping of perpetual rain, Made mere abortion: faith and innocence Are met with but in babes; each taking leave, Ere cheeks with down are sprinkled: he, that fasts While yet a stammerer, with his tongue let loose Gluts every food alike in every moon: One, yet a babbler, loves and listens to His mother; but no sooner hath free use Of speech, than he doth wish her in her grave. So suddenly doth the fair child of him, Whose welcome is the morn and eve his parting, To negro blackness change her virgin white. 4“The fair nest of Leda.” From the Gemini; thus called, because Leda was the mother of the twins, Castor and Pollux.

CANTO XXVIII PARADISE 403 “Thou, to abate thy wonder, note, that none Bears rule in earth; and its frail family Are therefore wanderers. Yet before the date, When through the hundredth in his reckoning dropt, Pale January must be shoved aside From winter’s calendar, these heavenly spheres Shall roar so loud, that fortune shall be fain’ To turn the poop, where she hath now the prow; So that the fleet run onward: and true fruit, Expected long, shall crown at last the bloom.” CANTO XXVIII ARGUMENT.—Still in the ninth heaven, our Poet is permitted to behold the divine essence; and then sees, in three hierarchies, the nine choirs of angels. Beatrice clears some difficulties which occur to him on this occasion. O she, who doth imparadise my soul, Had drawn the veil from off our present life, And bared the truth of poor mortality: When lo! as one who, in a mirror, spies The shining of a flambeau at his back, Lit sudden ere he deem of its approach, And turneth to resolve him, if the glass Have told him true, and sees the record faithful As note is to its metre; even thus, I well remember, did befal to me, Looking upon the beauteous eyes, whence love Had made the leash to take me. As I turn’d: And that which none, who in that volume looks, Can miss of, in itself apparent, struck My view; a point I saw, that darted light So sharp, no lid, unclosing, may bear up Against its keenness. The least star we ken From hence, had seem’d a moon; set by its side, As star by side of star. And so far off, Perchance, as is the halo from the light Which paints it, when most dense the vapour spreads; 18“Fortune shall be fain.” The com- he vainly hoped would follow on the Mentators in gencral suppose that our arrival of the Emperor Henry VII in Italy.

404 THE DIVINE COMEDY CANTO XXVIII There wheel’d about the point a circle of fire, More rapid than the motion which surrounds, Speediest, the world. Another this enring’d; And that a third; the third a fourth, and that A fifth encompass’d; which a sixth next bound; And over this, a seventh, following, reach’d Circumference so ample, that its bow, Within the span of Juno’s messenger, Had scarce been held entire. Beyond a seventh, Ensued yet other two. And every one, As more in number distant from the first, Was tardier in motion: and that glow’d With flame most pure, that to the sparkle of truth, Was nearest; as partaking most, methinks, Of its reality. The guide beloved Saw me in anxious thought suspense, and spake: “Heaven, and all nature, hangs upon that point. The circle thereto most conjoin’d observe; And know, that by intenser love its course Is, to this swiftness, wing’d.” To whom I thus: “It were enough; nor should I further seek, Had I but witness’d order, in the world Appointed, such as in these wheels is seen. But in the sensible world such difference is, That in each round shows more divinity, As each is wider from the centre. Hence, If in this wondrous and angelic temple, That hath, for confine, only light and love, My wish may have completion, I must know, Wherefore such disagreement is between The exemplar and its copy: for myself, Contemplating, I fail to pierce the cause.” “Tt is no marvel, if thy fingers foil’d Do leave the knot untied: so hard ’tis grown For want of tenting.” Thus she said: “But take,” She added, “if thou wish thy cure, my words, And entertain them subtly. Every orb, Corporeal, doth proportion its extent Unto the virtue through its parts diffused. The greater blessedness preserves the more,

CANTO XXVIII PARADISE 405 The greater is the body (if all parts Share equally) the more is to preserve. Therefore the circle, whose swift course enwheels The universal frame, answers to that Which is supreme in knowledge and in love. Thus by the virtue, not the seeming breadth Of substance, measuring, thou shalt see the Heavens, Each to the intelligence that ruleth it, Greater to more, and smaller unto less, Suited in strict and wondrous harmony.” As when the north blows from his milder cheek A blast, that scours the sky, forthwith our air, Clear’d of the rack that hung on it before, Glitters; and, with his beauties all unveil’d, The firmament looks forth serene, and smiles: Such was my cheer, when Beatrice drove With clear reply the shadows back, and truth Was manifested, as a star in Heaven. And when the words were ended, not unlike To iron in the furnace, every cirque, Ebullient, shot forth scintillating fires: And every sparkle shivering to new blaze, In number! did outmillion the account Reduplicate upon the chequer’d board. Then heard I echoing on, from choir to choir, “Hosanna,” to the fixed point, that holds, And shall for ever hold them to their place, From everlasting, irremovable. Musing awhile I stood: and she, who saw My inward meditations, thus began: “In the first circles, they, whom thou beheld’st Are Seraphim and Cherubim. Thus swift Follow their hoops, in likeness to the point, Near as they can, approaching; and they can The more, the loftier their vision. Those That round them fleet, gazing the Godhead next, Are Thrones; in whom the first trine ends.

All, as they circle in their orders, look Aloft; and, downward, with such sway prevail, That all with mutual impulse tend to God. These once a mortal view beheld. Desire In Dionysius,3 so intensely wrought, That he, as I have done, ranged them; and named, Their orders, marshal’d in his thought. From him, Dissentient, one refused his sacred read.

The book above referred to, which goes under his name, was the production of a later age. In Bishop Bull's seventh sermon, which treats of the different degrees of beatitude in Heaven, there is much that resembles what is said on the same subject by our Poet. The learned prelate, however, appears a little inconsistent, when, after having blamed Dionysius the Areopagite, “for reckoning up exactly the several orders of the angelical hierarchy, as if he had seen a muster of the heavenly host before his eyes” (v. i. p. 313), he himself speaks more particularly of the several orders in the celestial hierarchy than Holy Scripture warrants.

CANTO XXIX PARADISE 407 Both this and much beside of these our orbs, From an eye-witness to Heaven’s mysteries.” CANTO XXIX ARGUMENT.—Beatrice beholds, in the mirror of divine truth, some doubts which had entered the mind of Dante. These she resolves; and then digresses into a vehement reprehension of certain theologians and preachers in those days, whose ignorance or avarice induced them to substitute their own inventions for the pure word of the Gospel. O longer, than what time Latona’s twins Cover’d of Libra and the fleecy star, Together both, girding the horizon hang; In even balance, from the zenith poised; Till from that verge, each, changing hemisphere, Part the nice level; e’en so brief a space Did Beatrice’s silence hold. A smile Sat painted on her cheek; and her fix’d gaze Bent on the point, at which my vision fail’d: When thus, her words resuming, she began: “I speak, nor what thou wouldst inquire demand; For I have mark’d it, where all time and place Are present. Not for increase to Himself Of good, which may not be increased, but forth To manifest His glory by its beams; Inhabiting His own eternity, Beyond time’s limit or what bound soe’er To circumscribe His being; as He will’d, Into new natures, like unto Himself, Eternal Love unfolded. Nor before, As if in dull inaction, torpid, lay. For, not in process of before or aft, Upon these waters moved the Spirit of God. Simple and mix’d, both form and substance, forth To perfect being started, like three darts Shot from a bow three-corded.

But that what I disclose to thee is true, Those penmen,? whom the Holy Spirit moved In many a passage of their sacred book, Attest; as thou by diligent search shalt find: And reason,’ in some sort, discerns the same, Who scarce would grant the heavenly ministers, Of their perfection void, so long a space. Thus when and where these spirits of love were made, Thou know’st, and how: and, knowing, hast allay’d Thy thirst, which from the triple question‘ rose. Ere one had reckon’d twenty, e’en so soon, Part of the Angels fell: and in their fall, Confusion to your elements ensued. The others kept their station: and this task, Whereon thou look’st, began, with such delight, That they surcease not ever, day nor night, Their circling. Of that fatal lapse the cause Was the curst pride of him, whom thou hast seen Pent with the world’s incumbrance. Those, whom here Thou seest, were lowly to confess themselves Of His free bounty, who had made them apt For ministeries so high: therefore their views Were, by enlightening grace and their own merit, Exalted; so that in their will confirm’d They stand, nor fear to fall. For do not doubt, But to receive the grace, which Heaven vouchsafes, 'St. Jerome had described the Angels as created long before the rest of the universe; an opinion which Thomas Aquinas controverted. As in Gen. i. 1, and Eccles. xviii. 1. 3“Reason.” The heavenly ministers (“motori”) would have existed to no purpose if they had been created before the corporeal world, which they were to govern. 4 He had wished to know where, when, and how the Angels had been created, and these three questions had been resolved.

Now, without further help, if with good heed My words thy mind have treasured, thou henceforth This consistory round about mayst scan, And gaze thy fill. But, since thou hast on earth Heard vain disputers, reasoners in the schools, Canvass the angelic nature, and dispute Its powers of apprehension, memory, choice; Therefore, ‘tis well thou take from me the truth, Pure and without disguise; which they below, Equivocating, darken and perplex. “Know thou, that, from the first, these substances, Rejoicing in the countenance of God, Have held unceasingly their view, intent Upon the glorious vision, from the which Nought absent is nor hid: where then no change Of newness, with succession, interrupts, Remembrance, there, needs none to gather up Divided thought and images remote. “So that men, thus at variance with the truth, Dream, though their eyes be open; reckless some Of error; others well aware they err, To whom more guilt and shame are justly due. Each the known track of sage philosophy Deserts, and has a bye-way of his own: So much the restless eagerness to shine, And love of singularity prevail. Yet this, offensive as it is, provokes Heaven’s anger less, than when the Book of God Is forced to yield to man’s authority, Or from its straightness warp’d: no reckoning made What blood the sowing of it in the world Has cost; what favour for himself he wins, Who meekly clings to it. The aim of all Is how to shine: e’en they, whose office is To preach the Gospel, let the Gospel sleep, And pass their own inventions off instead.

Christ said not to His first conventicle, ‘Go forth and preach impostures to the world,’ But gave them truth to build on; and the sound Was mighty on their lips: nor needed they, Beside the Gospel, other spear or shield, To aid them in their warfare for the faith. The preacher now provides himself with store Of jests and gibes; and, so there be no lack Of laughter, while he vents them, his big cowl Distends, and he has won the meed he sought: Could but the vulgar catch a glimpse the while Of that dark bird which nestles in his hood, They scarce would wait to hear the blessing said, Which now the dotards hold in such esteem, That every counterfeit, who spreads abroad The hands of holy promise, finds a throng Of credulous fools beneath.

Look then how lofty and how huge in breadth The eternal Might, which, broken and dispersed Over such countless mirrors, yet remains Whole in itself and one, as at the first.” CANTO XXX AxrcuMENT.—Dante is taken up with Beatrice into the empyrean; and there having his sight strengthened by her aid, and by the virtue derived from looking on the river of light, he sces the triumph of the Angels and of the souls of the blessed. OON’S fervid hour perchance six thousand miles! From hence is distant; and the shadowy cone Almost to level on our earth declines; When, from the midmost of this blue abyss, By turns some star is to our vision lost. And straightway as the handmaid of the sun Puts forth her radiant brow, all, light by light, Fade; and the spangled frmament shuts in, E’en to the loveliest of the glittering throng. Thus vanish’d gradually from my sight The triumph, which plays ever round the point, That overcame me, seeming (for it did) Engirt? by that it girdeth. Wherefore love, With loss of other object, forced me bend Mine eyes on Beatrice once again. If all, that hitherto is told of her, Were in one praise concluded, ’twere too weak To furnish out this turn.

For as the sun doth to the feeblest sight, E’en so remembrance of that witching smile Hath dispossest my spirit of itself. Not from that day, when on this earth I first Beheld her charms, up to that view of them, Have I with song applausive ever ceased To follow; but now follow them no more; My course here bounded, as each artist’s is, When it doth touch the limit of his skill. She (such as I bequeath her to the bruit Of louder trump than mine, which hasteneth on Urging its arduous matter to the close) Her words resumed, in gesture and in voice Resembling one accustom’d to command: “Forth? from the last corporeal are we come Into the Heaven, that is unbodied light; Light intellectual, replete with love; Love of true happiness, replete with joy; Joy, that transcends all sweetness of delight. Here shalt thou look on either mighty host‘ Of Paradise; and one in that array, Which in the final judgment thou shalt see.” As when the lightning, in a sudden spleen Unfolded, dashes from the blinding eyes The visive spirits, dazzled and bedimm’d; So, round about me, fulminating streams Of living radiance play'd, and left me swathed And veiled in dense impenetrable blaze.

I look’d; And, in the likeness of a river, saw Light flowing, from whose amber-seeming waves Flash'd up effulgence, as they glided on *Twixt banks, on either side, painted with spring, Incredible how fair: and, from the tide, There ever and anon, outstarting, flew Sparkles instinct with life; and in the flowers Did set them, like to rubies, chased in gold: Then, as if drunk with odours, plunged again Into the wondrous flood; from which, as one Re-enter’d, still another rose. “The thirst Of knowledge high, whereby thou art inflamed, To search the meaning of what here thou seest, The more it warms thee, pleases me the more, But first behoves thee of this water drink, Or e’er that longing be allay’d.” So spake The day-star of mine eyes: then thus subjoin’d: “This stream; and these, forth issuing from its gulf, And diving back, a living topaz each; With all this laughter on its bloomy shores; Are but a preface, shadowy of the truth They emblem: not that, in themselves, the things Are crude; but on thy part is the defect, For that thy views not yet aspire so high.” Never did babe, that had outslept his wont, Rush, with such eager straining, to the milk, As I toward the water; bending me, To make the better mirrors of mine eyes In the refining wave: and as the eaves Of mine eyelids did drink of it, forthwith Seem’d it unto me turn’d from length to round. Then as a troop of maskers, when they put Their vizors off, look other than before; The counterfeited semblance thrown aside: So into greater jubilee were changed Those flowers and sparkles; and distinct I saw, 413

O prime enlightener! thou who gavest me strength On the high triumph of Thy realm to gaze; Grant virtue now to utter what I kenn’d. There is in Heaven a light, whose goodly shine Makes the Creator visible to all Created, that in seeing Him alone Have peace; and in a circle spreads so far, That the circumference were too loose a zone To girdle in the sun. All is one beam, Reflected from the summit of the first, That moves, which being hence and vigour takes. And as some cliff, that from the bottom eyes His image mirror’d in the crystal flood, As if to admire his brave apparelling Of verdure and of flowers; so, round about, Eying the light, on more than million thrones, Stood, eminent, whatever from our earth Has to the skies return’d. How wide the leaves, Extended to their utmost, of this rose, Whose lowest step embosoms such a space Of ample radiance! Yet, nor amplitude Nor height impeded, but my view with ease Took in the full dimensions of that joy. Near or remote, what there avails, where God Immediate rules, and Nature, awed, suspends Her sway? Into the yellow of the rose Perennial, which, in bright expansiveness, Lays forth its gradual blooming, redolent Of praises to the never-wintering sun, As one, who fain would speak yet holds his peace, Beatrice led me; and, “Behold,” she said, “This fair assemblage; stoles of snowy white, How numberless. The city, where we dwell, Behold how vast; and these our seats so throng’d, Few now are wanting here.

On looking round for Beatrice, he finds that she has left him, and that an old man is at his side. This proves to be St. Bernard, who shows him that Beatrice has returned to her throne, and then points out to him the blessedness of the Virgin Mother, N fashion, as a snow white rose, lay then Before my view the saintly multitude,!

But answer found from other than I ween’d; For, Beatrice, when I thought to see, I saw instead a senior, at my side, Robed, as the rest, in glory. Joy benign Glow’d in his eye, and o’er his cheek diffused, With gestures such as spake a father’s love. And, “Whither is she vanish’d?” straight I ask’d. “By Beatrice summon’d,” he replied, “T come to aid thy wish. Looking aloft To the third circle from the highest, there Behold her on the throne, wherein her merit Hath placed her.” Answering not, mine eyes I raised, And saw her, where aloof she sat, her brow A wreath reflecting of eternal beams. Not from the centre of the sea so far Unto the region of the highest thunder, As was my ken from hers; and yet the form Came through that medium down, unmix’d and pure. “O Lady! thou in whom my hopes have rest; Who, for my safety, hast not scorn’d, in Hell To leave the traces of thy footsteps mark’d; For all mine eyes have seen, I to thy power And goodness, virtue owe and grace. Of slave Thou hast to freedom brought me: and no means, For my deliverance apt, hast left untried. Thy liberal bounty still toward me keep: That, when my spirit, which thou madest whole, Is loosen’d from this body, it may find Favour with thee.” So I my suit preferr’d: And she, so distant, as appear’d, look’d down, And smiled; then toward the eternal fountain turn‘d. And thus the senior, holy and revered: “That thou at length mayst happily conclude Thy voyage, (to which end I was despatch'd, By supplication moved and holy love), Let thy upsoaring vision range, at large, This garden through: for so, by ray divine

And was this semblance Thine?” So gazed I then Adoring; for the charity of him,® Who musing, in this world that peace enjoy’d, Stood livelily before me. “Child of grace!” Thus he began: “Thou shalt not knowledge gain Of this glad being, if thine eyes are held Still in this depth below. But search around The circles, to the furthest, till thou spy Seated in state, the Queen’ that of this realm Is sovran.” Straight mine eyes I raised; and bright, As, at the birth of morn, the eastern clime Above the horizon, where the sun declines; So to mine eyes, that upward, as from vale To mountain sped, at the extreme bound, a part Excell’d in lustre all the front opposed. And as the glow burns ruddiest o’er the wave, That waits the ascending team, which Phaéton Ill knew to guide, and on each part the light Diminish’d fades, intensest in the midst; So burn’d the peaceful oriflame, and slack’d On every side the living flame decay’d. 8 “Bernard.” St. Bernard, the venerable Abbot of Clairvaux, and the great promoter of the Second Crusade, who died A.

That the part he acts in the present poem should be assigned to him, appears somewhat remarkable, when we consider that he severely censured the new festival established in honor of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin, and “opposed the doctrine itself with the greatest vigor, as it supposed her being honored with a privilege which belonged to Christ alone.” 7A copy in miniature of the picture of Christ, which is supposed to have been miraculously imprinted upon a handkerchief preserved in the church of St. Peter at Rome. §“Him.” St. Bernard. ®“The queen.” The Virgin Mary.

And he, who had to her descended, once, On earth, now hail’d in Heaven; and on poised wing, “Ave, Maria, Gratia Plena,” sang: To whose sweet anthem all the blissful court, From all parts answering, rang: that holier joy Brooded the deep serene. “Father revered! Who deign’st, for me, to quit the pleasant place Wherein thou sittest, by eternal lot; Say, who that Angel is, that with such glee Beholds our Queen, and so enamour’d glows Of her high beauty, that all fire he seems.” So I again resorted to the lore Of my wise teacher, he, whom Mary’s charms Embellish’d, as the sun the morning star; Who thus in answer spake: “In him are summ’d, 421

Where Anna sits, so well content to look On her loved daughter, that with moveless eye She chants the loud hosanna: while, opposed To the first father of your mortal kind, Is Lucia,’ at whose hest thy lady sped, When on the edge of ruin closed thine eye. “But (for the vision hasteneth to an end) Here break we off, as the good workman doth, That shapes the cloak according to the cloth; And to the Primal Love our ken shall rise; That thou mayst penetrate the brightness, far As sight can bear thee. Yet, alas! in sooth Beating thy pennons, thinking to advance, Thou backward fall’st. Grace then must first be gain’d; Her grace, whose might can help thee. Thou in prayer Seek her: and, with affection, whilst I sue, Attend, and yield me all thy heart.” He said; And thus the saintly orison began. 7S. John. &% See Heli, Canto ii. 97, and Purgatory, Canto ix. 50.

CANTO XXXITI PARADISE 423 CANTO XXXIII ARGUMENT.—St. Bernard supplicates the Virgin Mary that Dante may have grace given him to contemplate the brightness of the Divine Majesty, which is accordingly granted; and Dante then himself prays to God for ability to show forth some part of the celestial glory in his writings. Lastly, he is admitted to a glimpse of the great mystery; the Trinity, and the Union of Man with God. “ VIRGIN MOTHER, daughter of thy Son! Created beings all in lowliness Surpassing, as in height above them all; Term by the eternal counsel pre-ordain’d; Ennobler of thy nature, so advanced In thee, that its great Maker did not scorn, To make Himself his own creation; For in thy womb rekindling shone the love Reveal’d, whose genial influence makes now This flower to germin in eternal peace: Here thou to us, of charity and love, Art, as the noon-day torch; and art, beneath, To morta! men, of hope a living spring. So mighty art thou, Lady, and so great, That he, who grace desireth, and comes not To thee for aidance, fain would have desire Fly without wings. Not only him, who asks, Thy bounty succours; but doth freely oft Forerun the asking. Whatsoe’er may be Of excellence in creature, pity mild, Relenting mercy, large munificence, Are all combined in thee. Here kneeleth one, Who of all spirits hath review’d the state, From the world’s lowest gap unto this height. Suppliant to thee he kneels, imploring grace For virtue yet more high, to lift his ken Toward the bliss supreme. And I, who ne’er Coveted sight, more fondly, for myself, Than now for him, my prayers to thee prefer, (And pray they be not scant), that thou wouldst Each cloud of his mortality away, {drive Through thine own prayers, that on the sovran joy Unveil’d he gaze. This yet, I pray thee, Queen,

424 THE DIVINE COMEDY CANTO XXXII Who canst do what thou wilt; that in him thou Wouldst, after all he hath beheld, preserve Affection sound, and human passions quell. Lo! where, with Beatrice, many a saint Stretch their clasp’d hands, in furtherance of my suit.” The eyes, that Heaven with love and awe regards, Fix'd on the suitor, witness’d, how benign She looks on pious prayers: then fasten’d they On the everlasting light, wherein no eye Of creature, as may well be thought, so far Can travel tnward. I, meanwhile, who drew Near to the limit, where all wishes end, The ardour of my wish (for so behoved) Ended within me. Beckoning smiled the sage, That I should look aloft: but, ere he bade, Already of myself aloft I look’d; For visual strength, refining more and more, Bare me into the ray authentical Of sovran light. Thenceforward, what I saw, Was not for words to speak, nor memory’s self To stand against such outrage on her skill. As one, who from a dream awaken’d, straight, All he hath seen forgets; yet still retains Impression of the feeling in his dream; E’en such am I: for all the vision dies, As ’twere, away; and yet the sense of sweet, That sprang from it, still trickles in my heart. Thus in the sun-thaw is the snow unseal’d; Thus in the winds on flitting leaves was lost The Sibyl’s sentence. O eternal beam! [soar?) (Whose height what reach of mortal thought may Yield me again some little particle Of what Thou then appearedst; give my tongue Power, but to leave one sparkle of Thy glory, Unto the race to come, that shall not lose Thy triumph wholly, if Thou waken aught Of memory in me, and endure to hear The record sound in this unequal strain. Such keenness from the living ray I met, That, if mine eyes had turn’d away, methinks,

CANTO XXXIII PARADISE 425 I had been lost; but, so embolden’d, on I pass’d, as I remember, till my view Hover’d the brink of dread infinitude. O grace, unenvying of Thy boon! that gavest Boldness to fix so earnestly my ken On the everlasting splendour, that I look’d, While sight was unconsumed, and, in that depth, Saw in one volume clasp’d of love, whate’er The universe unfolds; all properties Of substance and of accident, beheld, Compounded, yet one individual light The whole. And of such bond methinks I saw The universal form; for that whene’er I do but speak of it, my soul dilates Beyond her proper self; and, till I speak, One moment seems a longer lethargy, Than five-and-twenty ages had appear’d To that emprize, that first made Neptune wonder At Argo’s shadow darkening on his flood. With fixed heed, suspense and motionless, Wondering I gazed; and admiration still Was kindled as I gazed. It may not be, That one, who looks upon that light, can turn To other object, willingly, his view. For all the good, that will may covet, there Is summ’d; and all, elsewhere defective found, Complete. My tongue shall utter now, no more E’en what remembrance keeps, than could the babe’s That yet is moisten’d at his mother’s breast. Not that the semblance of the living light Was changed, (that ever as at first remain’d), But that my vision quickening, in that sole Appearance, still new miracles descried, And toil’d me with the change. In that abyss Of radiance, clear and lofty, seem’d, methought, Three orbs of triple hue, clipt in one bound:! And, from another, one reflected seem’d, ! “Three orbs of triple hue, clipt in one second, and third, and of the impossibound.” The Trinity. This passage may bility that the human soul should attain be compared to what Plato, in his second to what it desires to know of them, by Epistle, enigmatically says of a first, means of anything akin to itself.

426 THE DIVINE COMEDY CANTO XXXII As rainbow is from rainbow: and the third Seem’d fire, breathed equally from both. O speech! How feeble and how faint art thou, to give Conception birth. Yet this to what I saw Is less than little. O eternal Light! Sole in Thyself that dwell’st; and of Thyself Sole understood, past, present, or to come; Thou smiledst, on that circling,? which in Thee Seem’d as reflected splendour, while I mused; For I therein, methought, in its own hue Beheld our image painted: steadfastly I therefore pored upon the view. As one, Who versed in geometric lore, would fain Measure the circle; and, though pondering long And deeply, that beginning, which he needs, Finds not: e’en such was I, intent to scan The novel wonder, and trace out the form, How to the circle fitted, and therein How placed: but the flight was not for my wing; Had not a flash darted athwart my mind, And, in the spleen, unfolded what it sought. Here vigour fail’d the towering fantasy: But yet the will roll’d onward, like a wheel In even motion, by the Love impell’d, That moves the sun in Heaven and all the stars. 2“That circling.” The second of the dimly beheld the mystery of the Incarcircles, “Light of Light,” in which he nation.
