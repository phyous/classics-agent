THE EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION TO THE HARVARD CLASSICS PURPOSE in selecting The Harvard Classics was to M exes the literary materials from which a careful and persistent reader might gain a fair view of the progress of man observing, recording, inventing, and imagining from the earliest historical times to the close of the nineteenth century. Within the limits of fifty volumes, containing about 22,000 pages, I was to provide the means of obtaining such a knowledge of ancient and modern literature as seems essential to the twentieth century idea of a cultivated man. The best acquisition of a cultivated man is a liberal frame of mind or way of thinking; but there must be added to that possession acquaintance with the prodigious store of recorded discoveries, experiences, and reflections which humanity in its intermittent and irregular progress from barbarism to civilization has acquired and laid up. From that store I proposed to make such a selection as any intellectually ambitious American family might use to advantage, even if their early opportunities of education had been scanty. The purpose of The Harvard Classics is, therefore, one very different from that of the many collections in which the editor’s aim has been to select the hundred or the fifty best books in the world; it is nothing less than the purpose to present so ample and characteristic a record of the stream of the world’s thought that the observant reader’s mind shall be enriched, refined, and fertilized by it. With such objects in view it was essential that the whole series should be in the English language; and this limitation to English necessitated the free use of translations, in spite of the fact that it is impossible to reproduce perfectly in a translation the style and 3

4 THE EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION flavor of the original. The reader of this collection must not imagine that he can find in an English translation of Homer, Dante, Cervantes, or Goethe, all the beauty and charm of the original. Nevertheless, translations can yield much genuine cultivation to the student who attends to the substance of the author’s thought, although he knows all the time that he is missing some of the elegance and beauty of the original form. Since it is impossible to give in translation the rhythm and sweetness of poetry—and particularly of lyric poetry—far the larger part of the poetry in The Harvard Classics will be found to be poetry which was written in English. While with very few exceptions every piece of writing included in the series is complete in itself—that is, is a whole book, narrative, document, essay, or poem—there are many volumes which are made up of numerous short, though complete, works. Thus, three volumes contain an anthology of English poetry comprising specimens of the work of over two hundred writers. There is also a volume of memorable prefaces, and another of important American historical documents. Five volumes are made up of essays, representing several centuries and several nationalities. The principal subjects embraced in the series are history, biography, philosophy, religion, voyages and travels, natural science, government and politics, education, criticism, the drama, epic and lyric poetry, and prose fiction —in short, all the main subdivisions of literature. The principal literatures represented in the collection are those of Greece, Rome, France, Italy, Spain, England, Scotland, Germany, and the United States; but important contributions have been drawn also from Chinese, Hindu, Hebrew, Arabian, Scandinavian, and Irish sources. Since the series is intended primarily for American readers, it contains a somewhat disproportionate amount of English and American literature, and of documents and discussions relating to American history and to the development of American social and political ideas. Chronologically considered, the series begins with portions of the sacred books of the oldest religions, proceeds with specimens of the literature of Greece and Rome, then makes selections from the literature of the Middle Ages in the Orient, Italy, France, Scandinavia, Ireland, England, Germany, and the Latin Church, includes a considerable representation of the literature of the Renaissance in Italy,

THE EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION 5 France, Germany, England, Scotland, and Spain, and, arriving at modern times, comprehends selections derived from Italy, three centuries of France, two centuries of Germany, three centuries of England, and something more than a century of the United States. Nothing has been included in the series which does not possess good literary form; but the collection illustrates the variations of literary form and taste from century to century, the wide separation in time of the recurrent climaxes in the various forms of literary expression in both prose and verse, and the immense widening of the range and scope of both letters and science during the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries. At the very outset of the work unexpected difficulties arose, some of which, although almost mechanical, proved to be insurmountable. Many famous books were too long to be included in the set, that is, they would have taken a disproportionate number of the fifty volumes. Thus, the English Bible could not be included as a whole, because it was too long; and for the same reason only selections from Shakespeare, and the first part of “Don Quixote,” could be included. Many famous and desirable books on history had to be excluded because of their length. The works of living authors were in general excluded, because the verdict of the educated world has not yet been pronounced upon them. Finally, the whole of nineteenth century fiction, with two exceptions, was excluded; partly because of its great bulk, and partly because it is easily accessible. It proved to be possible, however, to represent by selections complete in themselves the English Bible, Shakespeare, and some other works of the highest order. Some authors whose greatest works were too long to be included in the series could be represented by one or more of their shorter works. It was hard to make up an adequate representation of the scientific thought of the nineteenth century, because much of the most productive scientific thought has not yet been given a literary form. The discoverers’ original papers on chemistry, physics, geology, and biology have usually been presented to some scientific society, and have naturally been expressed in technical language, or have been filled with details indispensable from the scientific point of view but not instructive for the public in general.

6 THE EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION Although a good part of the reading provided in The Harvard Classics may fairly be called interesting, there are also volumes or portions of volumes which make hard reading, even for a practised student. In the literature of other days some of the topics treated are unfamiliar, and, moreover, the state of mind of the authors is apt to be strange to the present generation. The sentiments and opinions these authors express are frequently not acceptable to present-day readers, who have to be often saying to themselves: “This is not true, or not correct, or not in accordance with our beliefs.” It is, however, precisely this encounter with the mental states of other generations which enlarges the outlook and sympathies of the cultivated man, and persuades him of the upward tendency of the human race. The Harvard Classics, as a whole, require close attention and a resolute spirit on the part of the reader. Nevertheless large parts of the collection were undoubtedly composed just to give delight, or to show people how to win rational pleasures. Thus, the real values of almost all the tales, dramas, fiction, and poetry in the series are esthetic, not didactic, values. The interested reader ought to gain from them enjoyment and new power to enjoy. There is no mode of using The Harvard Classics which can be recommended as the best for all readers. Every student who proposes to master the series must choose his own way through it. Some readers may be inclined to follow the chronological order; but shall they begin with the oldest book and read down through the centuries, or begin with the youngest and read backward? Another method would be to read by subjects, and under each subject chronologically. A good field for this method is the collection of voyages and travels. There is also merit in the chronological order in reading the documents taken from the sacred books of the world. Still another method is that of comparison or of contrast. The collection gives many opportunities of comparing the views of contemporaneous writers on the same subject, and also of contrasting the prevailing opinions in different nations or different social states at the same epoch. In government and politics, for example, the collection supplies much material for comparing the opinions of writers nearly contemporary but of different nationality, and for contrasting the different social states at the same epoch in nations not far apart

=e THE EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 7 geographically, but distinct as regards their history, traditions, and habits. Another way of dealing with the collection would be to read first an essay or a group of essays on related subjects, and then to search through the collection to discover all the material it contains within the field of that essay or group of essays. The essays in the collection are numerous, and deal with a great variety of topics both old and new. Whoever should follow the various leadings of the essays in the collection would ultimately cover far the greater part of the fifty volumes. The biographies, letters, and prefaces contained in the collection will also afford much good guidance to other material. The student who likes the comparative method will naturally read consecutively all the dramas the collection contains; and it will not make much difference at which chronological end he begins, for some persons find the climax of drama in Shakespeare, but others in the Greek tragedies. The anthology of English poetry is one of the most important parts of the collection, in respect to its function of providing reading competent to impart liberal culture to a devoted reader; but those volumes should not be read in course, but rather by authors, and a little at a time. The poems of John Milton and Robert Burns are given in full; because the works of these two very unlike poets contain social, religious, and governmental teachings of vital concern for modern democracies. Milton was the great poet of civil and religious liberty, Puritanism, and the English Commonwealth, and Burns was the great poet of democracy. The two together cover the fundamental principles of free government, education, and democratic social structure, and will serve as guides to much good reading on those subjects provided in the collection. The poetry contained in The Harvard Classics from Homer to Tennyson will by itself give any appreciative reader a vivid conception of the permanent, elemental sentiments and passions of mankind, and of the gradually developed ethical means of purifying those sentiments and controlling those passions. In order to make the best use of The Harvard Classics it will be desirable for the young reader to reread those volumes or passages

8 THE EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION which he finds most interesting, and to commit to memory many of the pieces of poetry which stir or uplift him. It is a source of exquisite and enduring delight to have one’s mind stored with many melodious expressions of high thoughts and beautiful imagery. I hope that many readers who are obliged to give eight or ten hours a day to the labors through which they earn their livelihood will use The Harvard Classics, and particularly young men and women whose early education was cut short, and who must therefore reach the standing of a cultivated man or woman through the pleasurable devotion of a few minutes a day through many years to the reading of good literature. The main function of the collection should be to develop and foster in many thousands of people a taste for serious reading of the highest quality, outside of The Harvard Classics as well as within them. It remains to describe the manner in which The Harvard Classics have been made up. I had more than once stated in public that in my opinion a five-foot shelf would hold books enough to give in the course of years a good substitute for a liberal education in youth to any one who would read them with devotion, even if he could spare but fifteen minutes a day for reading. Rather more than a year ago the firm of P. F. Collier & Son proposed that I undertake to make a selection of fifty volumes, containing from four hundred to four hundred and fifty pages each, which would approximately fill my five-foot shelf, and be well adapted to accomplish the educational object I had in mind. I was invited to take the entire responsibility of making the selection, and was to be provided with a competent assistant of my own choice. In February, 1909, I accepted the proposal of the publishers, and secured the services of Dr. William A. Neilson, Professor of English in Harvard University, as my assistant. I decided what should be included, and what should be excluded. Professor Neilson wrote all the introductions and notes, made the choice among different editions of the same work, and offered many suggestions concerning available material. It also fell to him to make all the computations needed to decide the question whether a work desired was too long to be included. The most arduous part of his work was the

THE EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION 9 final making up of the composite volumes from available material which had commended itself to us both. It would have been impossible to perform the task satisfactorily if the treasures of the general library and of the department libraries of Harvard University had not been at our disposal. The range of the topics in the series was so wide, and the number of languages in which the desired books were originally written so great, that the advice of specialists, each in some portion of the field, had frequently to be sought. We obtained much valuable advice of this sort from scholarly friends and neighbors. We are under obligations to the following Harvard professors and instructors, whose advice we obtained on questions connected with their several specialties: Crawford Howell Toy, Hancock Professor of Hebrew; George Herbert Palmer, Alford Professor of Natural Religion; William James, Professor of Philosophy; William Morris Davis, SturgisHooper Professor of Geology; Ephraim Emerton, Winn Professor of Ecclesiastical History; Charles Rockwell Lanman, Wales Professor of Sanscrit; Edward Laurens Mark, Hersey Professor of Anatomy; George Foot Moore, Frothingham Professor of the History of Religion; Edward Stevens Sheldon, Professor of Romance, Philology; Horatio Stevens White, Professor of German; Josiah Royce, Professor of the History of Philosophy; Harold Clarence Ernst, Professor of Bacteriology; Herbert Weir Smyth, Eliot Professor of Greek Literature; Frank William Taussig, Henry Lee Professor of Economics; Albert Bushnell Hart, Professor of History; Morris Hicky Morgan, Professor of Classical Philology; Theobald Smith, George Fabyan Professor of Comparative Pathology; Albert Andrew Howard, Pope Professor of Latin; George Lyman Kittredge, Professor of English; Samuel Williston, Weld Professor of Law; Charles Hall Grandgent, Professor of Romance Languages; Hugo Miinsterberg, Professor of Psychology; Leo Wiener, Assistant Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures; Heinrich Conrad Bierwirth, Assistant Professor of German; Theodore William Richards, Professor of Chemistry; George Pierce Baker, Professor of English; James Haughton Woods, Assistant Professor of Philoso 

THE EDITOR’S SECOND INTRODUCTION N seven years The Harvard Classics have demonstrated their fitness for the special work they were intended to do. They were to provide from famous literature, ancient and modern, an ample record of “the stream of the world’s thought”; so that a careful reader of the collection might in the course of years attain the standing of a cultivated man or woman, making up through this long course of reading any deficiencies which might have existed in the early education of the reader. I hoped, too, that in spite of the serious character of the entire collection, an interested and patient reader would gain from the collection much enjoyment and a new power to enjoy. The experience of seven years has proved that the sale of The Harvard Classics has been large and, on the whole, increasing in amount. Most owners of the set select occasional reading matter from it; but some have read the fifty volumes through, and a few have read the entire set through twice. I have been surprised to see how often I turn to the collection to enjoy pieces of permanent literature, in contrast with the mass of ephemeral reading matter which I am obliged to go through. Many people might use it in this way to advantage. It has also turned out that the collection, through its excellent index, has value as a book of reference for the general reader, and can be especially helpful to teachers, journalists, and authors. In the original fifty volumes, for reasons which have turned out not to be of permanent effect, fiction in the modern sense was only slightly represented. To-day a supplement of twenty volumes of modern fiction— The Harvard Classics Shelf of Fiction—provides an ample representation of that new force in the world which the modern historical romance, the novel, and the short story exert. With this supplement The Harvard Classics may fairly be said to provide a permanent record in high literary form of the powers and achievements of “man thinking” down to the end of the nineteenth century, sufficiently comprehensive to illustrate well the chief powers and achievements of the race. The last half of the nineteenth century and the opening of the twen13

14 THE EDITOR’S SECOND INTRODUCTION tieth show a strong tendency to discard the study of the Greek and Latin languages as an indispensable part of American secondary and higher education. This study is to be replaced in part by the study of modern languages, which have many uses in the literary, scientific, and business life of to-day. It is the confident belief of the educational reformers that young people brought up in this new way need not lose the substantial values of ancient thought; because they can get them through translations. The Harvard Classics contain six and a half volumes of choice material for this purpose. The collection contains also three volumes and two half volumes of famous writings belonging to the Middle Ages, writings, which can only be made known to the present generations through translations. The reader who makes himself familiar with these ten volumes and a half, with the Confessions of St. Augustine, and with the two volumes of Sacred Writings, may feel sure that he has followed the course of the best thinking of mankind down to the Italian Renaissance. From these volumes, the thorough reader may learn valuable lessons in comparative literature. He can see how various the contributions of the different languages and epochs have been; and he will inevitably come to the conclusion that striking national differences in this respect ought in the interest of mankind to be perpetuated and developed, and not obliterated, averaged, or harrowed down. The comparative method has in the study of literature a value similar to that it has recently exhibited in the study of art, government, science, and religion. One may hope that the collection will endure for some decades to come, not only as a monument or milestone, but also as an active force toward the sound mental equipment of American reading people, both hy.

READER’S GUIDE

READER’S GUIDE TO THE HARVARD CLASSICS HE following lists have been prepared in order to enable the reader more easily to choose and arrange for himself such courses of study as have been suggested in the Introduction. They fall into two classes, the first being selected with respect to subject-matter, as History, Philosophy, or Science; the second with respect to literary form, as the Drama or Essay. Within each group the arrangement is in general chronological, but this has been occasionally departed from when it seemed wise to introduce national or geographical cross-divisions. While most of the volumes can be most profitably read in some chronological or other sequence, many others, such as the collections of English Poetry and of Essays, are equally suited for more desultory browsing. These lists are not intended to relieve the reader from the use of the General Index, which has purposely been made so ample that it is possible by its intelligent use to track almost any line of interest through the entire set of volumes.

CLASS I A THE HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION "Ts following list is by no means confined to works regarded by their authors as history, but includes letters, dramas, novels, and the like, which, by virtue of their character, period, or scene, throw light upon social and intellectual conditions, enriching and making vivid the picture of human progress which is outlined in the more strictly historical narratives. Professor Freeman’s essay, which is suggested as a general introduction to this division, deals in a highly illuminating fashion with the much misunderstood term, “Race”; and by definition and illustration brings out the elements according to which the historian and the anthropologist determine the relationships among the families of mankind. The oldest civilization with which the ordinary reader has any acquaintance is that of Egypt, and his knowledge of this is usually confined to the dealings of the Egyptians with the Israelites, as narrated in the first books of the Old Testament. The account of Egypt by Herodotus gives a picture of this people from the point of view of a Greek, and is made entertaining by the skill of one of the best story-tellers in the world. A glimpse of life in the days of the patriarchs, in the countries surrounding Palestine, is given in the narrative portions of “The Book of Job,’ where Job himself is concerned as a powerful and wealthy sheik. With Homer we come to the civilization which, more than any other, has affected the culture of modern Europe. The wanderings of Odysseus in the “Odyssey” and the account of the fall of Troy in the “AEneid” contain, of course, a large mythical element; but they 19

20 READER'S GUIDE leave, nevertheless, a vivid picture which must represent with much essential truth the way of life of the Greeks before the historic period. The two poems by Tennyson named here were suggested by the “Odyssey,” and express with remarkable power and beauty the modern poet’s conception of the Greek hero’s character, and the mood of reaction from the life of effort and suffering. The pieces by Wordsworth and Landor are modern retellings of stories from the same treasure-house from which the Greek tragedians drew the plots of those great dramas which, with the dialogues of Plato, represent the height of intellectual achievement in the ancient world. The five Greek lives by Plutarch give portraits of a group of the most distinguished men of affairs in the same period. Plutarch again, in his “Lives” of famous Romans, brings before us several of the greatest figures of Republican Rome. His main interest was in personality; but incidentally he gives much information as to the political history of this period. For the years immediately preceding the end of the Republic, the “Letters” of Cicero give a detailed picture of Roman politics from the inside. In spite of the frequent allusions to events and persons now known only to the scholar, the general reader may easily find interest in the similarities between the political methods of antiquity and those of our own day. Dryden’s “All for Love” is a thorough making-over of Shakespeare’s “Antony and Cleopatra,” which in turn is based on Plutarch’s “Life of Antony.” It is interesting, not only as an excellent example of Dryden’s work as a dramatist, but as affording, along with Shakespeare’s tragedy, a suggestive study of two of the most picturesque figures of ancient times. From the Alexandrian scenes one can gain an impression of the luxury that was beginning to sap the foundations of the old Roman virtue. Pliny’s “Letters” picture the life of a cultivated Roman under the Empire. Among them, special interest attaches to that giving a graphic account of the eruption of Vesuvius which destroyed Pompeii, and in which the elder Pliny perished, and to those in which Pliny as proconsul consults with the Emperor Trajan about the policy of persecuting the early Christians. The story of the “Aineid” does not deal with this period; but its patriotic purpose makes it important in judging the spirit of the times. Tennyson’s tribute to

THE HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION 21 Virgil is a superb appreciation of the literary quality of the Roman writer, with whom the Englishman had many points of kinship. In the writings of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius and the slave Epictetus, the moral philosophy of paganism reaches its highest level. The condition of our Teutonic ancestors during the period of Roman supremacy is admirably described by the historian Tacitus in his account of Germany. The description is external, but wellinformed, and is the work of an acute and highly trained observer of society and politics. More intimate are the poems that have come down from the early period of Germanic culture, represented here by the Old English “Beowulf,” and the Icelandic “Song of the Volsungs.” These stories deal with incidents and personages whose historic bases belong to continental Europe, though the earliest extant literary poems of both happen to be insular. “Beowulf” is the more circumstantial as a picture of life and manners; the Volsung story in its various versions, through the “Nibelungenlied” down to Wagner's operas, has made a more profound appeal to the imagination. The splendid though grotesque specimen of Irish sagawriting given in “The Destruction of Da Derga’s Hostel” belongs to nearly the same period. In the case of all three, the material represents a stage of culture considerably earlier than the date of writing, and still essentially pagan. The books from the New Testament are selected to give the story of the founding of Christianity; St. Augustine’s “Confessions” exhibit the development, after a few centuries, of Christian doctrine, Christian standards of conduct, and Christian ways of thinking; while the Hymns of the Early Church, East and West, represent the lyrical expression of the devotional feeling of the young religion. While Christianity was gradually overcoming the paganism of Europe, Mohammed appeared in Arabia; and from the chapters of the “Koran,” which he claimed to have received by inspiration, we can form an idea of the teaching which, with the aid of the sword, so rapidly conquered the East. “The Arabian Nights” are Mohammedan in background, the multiplicity of angels and genii which the

22 READER'S GUIDE Prophet admitted into his system playing a large part in the mechanism of the tales. The representation of the social life of the East is, however, more important than the religious element in these. Omar Khayyam is the free-thinking philosopher in a Mohammedan society, and his quatrains are given here in the free paraphrase of Fitzgerald, a work which ranks higher as ar. original poem than as an exact translation. The Middle Ages denotes a period with somewhat vague boundaries; and some of the books already touched on might well be placed within it. Here it includes representative literary products of Western Europe from the time of Charlemagne to the middle of the fifteenth century. “The Song of Roland” begins, on a slight historical foundation, the great structure of French epic, and is itself a simple and vigorous celebration of heroic loyalty. In the passages from the Norse “Saga of Eric the Red” which describes the discovery of America by Icelanders about 1000 A. D., we get a glimpse of the hardy life of the Vikings. In “The Divine Comedy” Dante summed up the essential characteristics of the spiritual and intellectual life of the Middle Ages, and by his emotional intensity and the extraordinary distinctness of his imaginative vision gave his result an artistic preeminence that makes it the supreme creation of the epoch. The pageantry and pomp of the military and court life of this age are seen at their best in the pages of Froissart; and in Marlowe’s “Edward the Second” a dramatic genius of the next period interprets a typical tragedy of the medieval contest between king and nobles. Drayton, Marlowe’s contemporary, celebrates, in one of our greatest war-songs, the victory of Agincourt. In contrast with these pictures of the more exciting sides of medieval life is the exquisite series of portraits of typical English men and women which give Chaucer’s “Prologue” its unique place among the works, literary and historical, of the time. Malory, Tennyson, and Morris deal with parts of the great Arthurian legend, the most wide-spread and characteristic of the themes which entranced the imagination of the Middle Ages, and one which continues to attract the modern writer. Romantic in tone,

THE HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION 23 historical in incident, Rossetti’s poem on the death of James I. of Scots is one of the most successful modern attempts to render a medieval theme in ballad form; yet its essential literary quality will be apparent at once when it is compared with the popular tone of the genuine traditional ballads. Our list of the productions of the Renaissance naturally begins with Italy, the country in which the great revival of interest in pagan antiquity first showed itself, and from which came in large measure the impulse to throw off the traditional bonds that had fettered the human spirit in the Middle Ages, and to seek a fuller scope for individual development. Machiavelli and Cellini represent respectively the political and the artistic sides of the Italy of this period; and the impression to be derived from them may be made more distinct by Browning’s pictures of the scholar, the painter, and the worldly ecclesiastic, and by Webster’s and Shelley’s dramas, with their lurid light on the passion and crime which reigned in much of the courtly life of the time. A pleasing contrast is afforded by Roper’s Life of the saintly Sir Thomas More, and by More’s own “Utopia,” with its vision of a perfect society. Later in the sixteenth century came the struggle of Spain to subjugate the Netherlands, an incident of which forms the plot of Goethe’s “Egmont.” Sir Walter Raleigh, compiling in his prison his vast “History of the World,” prefixed to it a long preface which gives us a most interesting conception of the attitude of an Englishman who had lived and thought not only upon the history of past times, but upon the whole problem of man’s relation to God and the universe. About the same time, in Spain, the great novelist, Cervantes, was showing in his masterpiece how quickly the world was passing from under the domination of the chivalrous ideals of the previous age. So far we have been enumerating documents representative of the secular Renaissance. But a religious revolution had also taken place, and in the works of Luther, of Calvin, and of Knox, we have a statement in the words of the leaders themselves of the fundamental principles of the Protestant Reformation. In Science also a new beginning had been made. In the “Journeys” of Ambroise Paré we have, incidentally, a picture of the armies of

24 READER'S GUIDE the sixteenth century in the field, and also, of more importance to posterity, the beginnings of a new and more humane surgery. Copernicus introduced his revolutionary theory by which the sun took the place of the earth as the center of our system, and Columbus, Vespucci, and the great English navigators opened up the Western world and circumnavigated the globe. In England itself this exploration of the West brought on the conflict with Spain celebrated with fiery patriotism in the poems by Drayton, Macaulay, and Tennyson. How Englishmen lived at home is told in intimate detail in Harrison’s “Description,” and more dramaticaily represented by Dekker, Jonson, and Beaumont; while in Keats’s lines we have a later poet harking back to those literary triumphs which are perhaps the most permanent of the achievements of the “spacious times of great Elizabeth.” In the seventeenth century we find ourselves in what may be regarded as modern times, though the picture of the plague in Manzoni’s great novel still suggests a period far remote from modern science. In the “Areopagitica,” however, Milton is arguing for that freedom of the press which is a very living question in many modern states; and in the poems of Marvell and Scott we have echoes of the struggle for constitutional liberty through which modern Britain came into existence. Voltaire’s “Letters” reflect not only the impressions derived by an acute Frenchman from a visit to England, but describe many important phases of the life and thought of the eighteenth century. Burke’s “Reflections” recall the excesses through which some of the things which Voltaire envied the English were achieved by France; and Goethe in his exquisite idyl, “Hermann and Dorothea,” lets us hear the echoes of the great Revolution in the quiet life of a German village. In Byron’s famous lyric we have a lament over the spirit of liberty not yet reawakened in Greece. Throughout all these later pieces there appear, more or less distinctly, evidences of the gradual spread over the world of the struggle for freedom and equality. Of this struggle in America the records collected in the “American Historical Documents” and the other works here enumerated need no interpretation.

B RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY N THIS division are represented the sacred writings of the l chief religions of the world, and characteristic works of the most important philosophers, so far as these can be expected to be intelligible to readers without technical training in philosophy. Here, as elsewhere in The Harvard Classics, the interest and profit of the reader have been preferred to formal completeness; yet it has been possible to bring together a selection of the attempts of thinkers to solve the problems of life for twenty-five centuries, with surprisingly few important omissions. In Class I, A, of the Reader’s Guide we noted the historical interest of the narrative setting of “The Book of Job.” The speeches themselves show the Hebrew mind wrestling with the problem of reconciling the justice of God with the misfortunes of the righteous. “Ecclesiastes” consists mainly of a collection of pungent and, for the most part, pessimistic comments on life, interspersed with passages of a more inspiring nature, which may be due to a different author. Both books are marvels of literary beauty. “The Psalms” gave utterance to the religious emotions of the people of Israel through many generations, and have appealed to the devout of races and periods far beyond the limits of their origin. Plato is at once a philosopher and a great man of letters; and the three dialogues given here not only present some of the main ideas about conduct and the future world which he received from Socrates or developed himself, but also draw a distinct and attractive portrait of his master during the closing scenes of his life. The plays of the Greek tragedians, though ostensibly dramatic entertainments, deal profoundly and impressively with some of the vital questions of religion, as these presented themselves to the Greek mind. In Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus we have the loftiest expression 29

30 READER'S GUIDE of the Stoic doctrine in its application to the conduct of life; and in the treatises of Cicero the working philosophy of a great lawyer and politician. The “Sayings” of Confucius, like these Roman writings, are ethical rather than religious; and while to the Western mind they appear curiously concerned with ceremonial, they still appeal to us through their note of aspiration toward a lofty and disinterested scheme of life. Equally remote in their religious and philosophical background are the examples of Hindu and Buddhist teaching, but here again there is much that is inspiring in the moral ideals. In the previous section, “The Gospel of Luke,” “The Acts of the Apostles,” and “The Epistles to the Corinthians” were regarded as giving the history of the founding of the Christian Church. Here they should be read as giving a statement of its principles as laid down by its Founder and His immediate followers. Its development after four centuries is shown in the “Confessions” of one of the greatest of the Fathers; and the height of medieval devoutness is beautifully exhibited in “The Imitation of Christ,” ascribed to Thomas 4 Kempis, one of the most widely circulated books in the history of literature. The Hymns of the Early Churches bring out those features of Christian belief which obtained prominence in public worship. Mohammedanism, with its curious borrowings from Hebrew and Christian scripture and tradition, is more interesting as the religion of many millions of people than as a source of spiritual inspiration. An interesting comparison may be made between Omar Khayyam in his relation to Mohammedanism and the author of “Ecclesiastes” in his relation to Judaism. With the Reformation opens a new chapter in the history of religion, and the figures of Luther, Calvin, and Knox appropriately represent militant Protestantism in Germany, Switzerland, and Scotland. Raleigh is a Protestant layman, a man of action rather than a theologian or philosopher, yet his “Preface” is a remarkably enlightening presentation of the attitude of a detached thinker at the beginning of the seventeenth century. His poems, with those of Southwell, Habington, Rowlands, Herbert, Donne, Quarles, Vaughan, Crashaw, Drummond, Wotton, Watts, Addison, and Christopher

RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY 31 Smart, and the collection of modern hymns, still further express, with varieties of emphasis and shade of opinion, the more popular aspects of modern Christianity. In Walton’s “Lives” of George Herbert and John Donne, Christian ideals are exhibited in the history of two men of strongly marked character and lofty spirituality. Sir Thomas Browne was a member of the Church of England and a physician, and the splendid prose of his “Religio Medici” conveys a quaint mixture of orthodoxy and independent thought. “The Pilgrim’s Progress” is the great popular presentation of Puritan theology in imaginative form; and this theology is again the background of the great religious lyrics and epics of John Milton. Roman Catholic thought on religion and life is brilliantly represented in the writings of Pascal, one of the most acute minds and most intensely religious spirits of his age. The “Thoughts,” collected and arranged after his death, suffer from lack of sequence; but their fragmentary nature cannot disguise from the careful reader the astounding keenness of the intellect behind them. In the “Fruits of Solitude” of William Penn, and in John Woolman’s “Journal,” we have a representation of the views and ideals of the Quakers, who contributed so important a stream of spiritual influence to the Colonial life of America. Modern philosophy is often said to begin with Bacon, and, though the fresh attack upon the problems of the universe made in the seventeenth century can not be credited to any one person, Bacon as much as any has a right to be regarded as the herald of the new era. The prefatory documents listed here indicate not only the nature and scope of his intellectual ambitions, but present in considerable detail his program for the conquest of nature and his “new instrument” for the advancement of science. The “Essays” deal with a thousand points of practical philosophy; and “The New Atlantis” outlines his view of a model state and foreshadows the modern research university. For philosophy in its more technical sense Descartes is more important than Bacon, and his influence on succeeding thought is more clearly traceable. Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume carried on the quest for philosophical truth in England, and were able to express their views in language that is still intelligible to the ordi 

32 READER'S GUIDE nary man. Pope, in his “Essay on Man,” put into polished and elegant verse, the more obvious principles of a group of thinkers of his day; but the ideas are more memorable on account of their quotable form than their profundity or subtlety. Voltaire, writing on many aspects of English life, includes in his “Letters” a condensed account of the philosophy of Locke and the investigations of Newton. Rousseau in his “Discourse,” one of the earliest of his writings, expounds the fundamentals of that social philosophy which he expanded later in the “Social Contract” and elsewhere, and which had so important a place among the influences leading up to the French Revolution. Lessing, clinging much closer to essential Christianity than Voltaire or Rousseau, elaborates in his “Education of the Human Race” the views he upheld in opposition to the less liberal theologians of Protestant Germany. With Kant and his successors philosophy becomes more a professional subject, and with an increase in depth and subtlety it loses in breadth of appeal to the world at large. Yet the treatises mentioned in this list will yield to the reader who cares to apply his mind an idea of a view of ethics of immense possibilities of influence over his thought and conduct. A large part of the remaining titles are of poems whose philosophical bearing it is scarcely necessary to point out. More and more during the last hundred years poetry has been made the medium of serious thought on the problems of life; and if one wishes to learn what earnest and cultivated people have thought on such matters in our day and that of our fathers, as much is to be gained from the poéts as from the professional metaphysicians or moralists. In Carlyle and Emerson we have two writers who can not be regarded as systematic philosophers, and who yet have been among the most influential of modern thinkers. Mill has a more definite place in the history of philosophy; but in his fascinating account of his own development, and in his essay “On Liberty,” we need have no fear of technical jargon, and may find a clear picture of a mind finely representative of English thought in the middle of the nineteenth century, and an abundance of ideas capable of application to the problems of our own day.

e EDUCATION HE earlier discussions on education differ from most modern writings on the subject in one important respect: the author had his eye on the single youth, the son of a family of birth and wealth, who was to be educated alone; while the educational theorist of to-day, even when he is not dealing with popular elementary education, is usually concerned with institutions for training pupils in large groups. This distinction has inevitably a profound effect upon the nature of the principles laid down. Montaigne, Locke, and Milton are all examples of this earlier kind of discussion. It is assumed that all resources are at command, and the only questions to be settled are the comparative value of subjects and the best order and method of learning. On these points the opinions of these men are still valuable; and all three, but especially Locke, give incidentally much information on the manners and state of culture of their times. The five “Essays” by Bacon named here do not form an attempt to construct a scheme of education, but deal suggestively with single points of importance in the training of children. “The New Atlantis” describes in “Solomon’s House” an elaborate institution for advancing knowledge, which anticipates in many respects the departments for research in modern universities. Swift’s so called “Treatise” deals lightly with social rather than intellectual culture; and the chapter on the “Education of Women” by his contemporary, Defoe, shows how long it is since some views which we are apt to regard as entirely modern have been put forward. Lessing’s treatise is more philosophical than educational in the ordinary sense, being rather an interpretation of history as the record of the development of the race than a plan for the future. The 36

EDUCATION 37 letters in which Schiller discussed the “Aisthetic Education of Man” contain the essence of his views on art. It is characteristic of American democracy that the lectures by Channing should be on the elevation of the laboring classes, and should take up an educational problem at the end of the social scale most remote from that where Montaigne and Locke found their interest. Mill’s “Autobiography” is an account of great interest of the education of a remarkable son by a remarkable father; and though containing much that has no direct bearing upon the training of the average child, it is valuable as showing what extraordinary results can be achieved under exceptional conditions. Newmans discussion of “The Idea of a University” deals with the ultimate aims of university education, and some of the more important considerations affecting the means of attaining them. Carlyle’s address, delivered at Edinburgh while he was Lord Rector of his own University, is a sort of summary of an old man’s wisdom on questions of a student’s use of his time and the choice of his reading. Ruskin’s well-known lectures, “Sesame and Lilies,” deal in very different, but equally characteristic fashion with similar topics. In “Science and Culture,” Huxley presents from the point of view of the scientist his side of the standing question of modern education: the comparative value of science and the classics as a means of culture.

D SCIENCE HE writings of ancient times on physical science are now mainly of historical and curious interest; but from Greek times have come down these two interesting formulas to which the name of Hippocrates is attached, which show how loftly a conception the ancient physician held of his function, and which form the basis of the professional ethics of the modern doctor. The army surgeon is a modern official. In the sixteenth century, even an officer who wished medical or surgical attendance had to take his personal doctor with him, or trust to the quacks who swindled the rank and file. Paré was such a personal surgeon to several distinguished generals through many campaigns; and the account of his improvements in the treatment of wounds vies in interest with his description of the battles themselves. Few single scientific discoveries have influenced the world so profoundly as that which showed that the earth was not the center of the universe. The treatise in which Copernicus put forth the new theory is filled with arguments which are often preposterous, so that for the true explanation of the motions of the heavenly bodies the book is practically useless. But from his “Dedication” we gather something of the spirit of the man who led the way in this momentous reform. The “Principia” of Newton has immeasurably greater scientific value, but the reasoning is highly technical, so that the ordinary reader is glad to get the great physicist’s own statement of the purpose and method of the work which first expounded the law of gravitation. The papers by Harvey and Jenner are landmarks in the history of physiology and medicine, the one explaining for the first time the true theory of the circulation of the blood; the other putting forward the method of vaccination which has relieved the world of the scourge of smallpox. 39

40 READER'S GUIDE Faraday was not only a great investigator but also a great teacher, and these two books by him are classical expositions of fundamental laws in physics and chemistry. Dr. Holmes’s paper is an interesting scientific argument, which proved of immense value in saving life; it is also an inspiring instance of the courage of a young scientist in risking professional disaster by attacking the practices and prejudices of his colleagues. The theories which lie behind Lord Lister’s application of the antiseptic principle in surgery are expounded in the fascinating papers in which Pasteur makes the original argument for the germ theory of disease, and founds the science of bacteriology. In the chapters included in the following list from Sir Charles Lyell’s “Principles of Geology,” he combats the notion that to explain the present condition of the earth it is necessary to assume a series of great catastrophes. A more comprehensive view of a modern geologist’s theory of how the physical world arrived at its present form is given in Geikie’s essay on “Geographical Evolution.” The great German physicist, von Helmholtz, is here represented by a lecture on the fundamental principle of the conservation of energy, and one on the theory of glaciers, while his colleague in Britain, Sir William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, expounds the wave theory of light and the movement of the tides. It was on the voyage of the “Beagle” that Darwin collected the material which suggested to him the great generalization later set forth in “The Origin of Species,” and gave currency to a theory of development that has proved to be the most pervasive and influential force in the intellectual progress of modern times. How enormously modern astronomical investigation has increased our notion of the universe, of which we form so minute a part, is expounded by Newcomb in his essay on “The Extent of the Universe.” Thus in the scientific section of these volumes the reader may gain from the pens of the leaders and discoverers themselves an idea of many of the most important conceptions in the sciences of Medicine, Surgery, Physiology, Biology, Bacteriology, Physics, Chemistry, Geology, and Astronomy.

E POLITICS ROM the point of view that “history is past politics,” it is eviHk dent that such historical documents as those in the “Lives” of Plutarch and the “Letters” of Cicero and Pliny are also of value from the political point of view. Many of the problems of politics change their form rather than their essence from age to age, and in these records of the political struggles and principles of antiquity there are many illuminating parallelisms to the conditions of our own day. Even the contrast to modern democratic ideas of government which the theories of Machiavelli afford is suggestive; and in the institutions of Elizabethan England as described by William Harrison we may often find the germ of practices which persist here to-day. More’s “Utopia” and Bacon’s “New Atlantis” have the value belonging to any sketch of ideal conditions drawn up by men of capacity and experience; and, with much that is fantastic, both books still afford considerable practical suggestion for political progress. Those of Bacon’s “Essays” which touch political topics contain abundance of acute observations on the conduct of public men, though the advice is sometimes, but not always, more suited to forming politicians than statesmen. Though dealing with the special subject of unlicensed printing, Milton, in his “Areopagitica,” handles with a noble eloquence many of the fundamental questions affecting free government. Defoe’s pamphlet treats in ironical strain the situation during a later period in the progress of England towards freedom and equality—in this case, religious equality; while Voltaire, coming from France a few years later, expresses his admiration for English tolerance. Of Rousseau’s “Discourse” we have already spoken (I. A). “The Wealth of Nations” may be regarded as founding the mod42

POLITICS 43 ern science of political economy; and it remains the greatest general treatise on the subject. The present edition has been relieved of those passages which are out of date and no longer of value. In Burke’s eloquent “Reflections” we get the view taken by an English constitutionalist of the principles of the French Revolution while it was still in progress; and in his “Letter to a Noble Lord” a vivid glimpse of the workings of politics in England at the same period. Mill’s treatise “On Liberty” is a classical argument on the relation of the individual to the state. The poetry of the nineteenth century contains much political as well as philosophical thinking; and the pieces by Goldsmith, Wordsworth, and Tennyson are favorable examples of the impassioned treatment of these themes in verse. The interest and importance of the American Documents here collected are obvious; and a careful study of these alone will go far to give a basis for an intelligent understanding of contemporary politics.

F VOYAGES AND TRAVELS E story of travel has always held a general fascination; | and little is needed to introduce to the reader such a list as follows. Beginning with the account of ancient Egypt by Herodotus, the collection gives the narratives of the early voyages to America of Leif Ericsson, Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci, and Cabot; the campaigns followed by the French surgeon, Ambroise Paré, in the sixteenth century; the voyages, partly for exploration, largely for plunder, of the great seamen of Elizabeth’s time, Drake, Gilbert, and Raleigh; and, in striking contrast, John Eliot’s “Brief Narrative” of his travels in the attempt to propagate the Gospel among the American Indians. Goldsmith’s “Traveller” describes many scenes in eighteenth century Europe; and in Dana’s absorbing “Two Years Before the Mast” we have the double interest of a picture of life on a sailing vessel two generations ago, and an admirable account of California as it was under the Spaniards, and before ’49. Darwin’s “Voyage of the Beagle,” apart from its scientific importance, is a highly interesting and modestly told story of exploration in remote seas. Emerson’s “English Traits” is a penetrating description and criticism of England, its people and its institutions, as the American philosopher saw it in the middle of the nineteenth century.

G CRITICISM OF LITERATURE AND THE FINE ARTS ILLIAM CAXTON, the first printer in England, took a \ \ ; much more personal interest in the productions of his press than does the modern publisher. He himself made several of the translations which he printed; and to other books he attached Prologues and Epilogues, which, if not quite literary criticism after the modern manner, are yet interesting indications of the qualities which made the works which Caxton selected for publication the favorite reading of the end of the Middle Ages. Of the three critical writings selected from the sixteenth century, Montaigne’s is a delightful talk on his personal tastes (see essay by Sainte-Beuve below); Sidney defends imaginative literature against the assaults of an extreme Puritan; and Spenser explains to his friend Raleigh the plan and purpose of “The Faerie Queene.” Shakespeare, as is well known, paid no attention to the printing of his plays; and it was left for two of his fellow actors to make the first collected edition of them, seven years after his death. The unique importance of the volume makes the address of its editors to the readers a matter of curious interest. Of more real significance are the opinions, friendly yet candid, which Ben Jonson has left of his great fellow dramatist, and of his patron, Bacon. But it is with Dryden that we come to the first English critic on a large scale; and in his discussions on Chaucer and on Heroic Poetry we have him, both for style and matter, at his best. Swift’s “Advice” is slighter, and, like all his work, displays his ironic temper. Fielding, in a prefatory chapter, defines and expounds his idea of a novel. Dr. Johnson’s famous essay on Shakespeare originally formed the Preface to his edition of the plays; and it remains one of the most 47

48 READER'S GUIDE important estimates of the genius of our greatest writer. In the “Life of Addison,” Johnson was dealing with a subject where his eighteenth century limitations hampered him less, and the result is a delightful piece of appreciative criticism. , So far the criticism in this list has been wholly literary. The next four writers are concerned with esthetic principles in general, with, perhaps, a special interest in painting and sculpture. Goethe, in this manifesto of a new periodical to be devoted to the Fine Arts, gives impressively his view of the fundamentals of artistic training. Schiller, on a more extensive scale, treats of the cultivation of taste and the nature of the pleasure to be derived from art; while Hume and Burke deal with similar problems from different points of view. The “Prefaces” of Wordsworth and Hugo express in different but equally characteristic terms the revolt of the romantic poets of England and France respectively against the classical conventions that dominated poetry and the drama. Coleridge discourses in his own profound and often illuminating fashion on the essentials of poetry, as does Shelley in his eloquent and philosophical “Defense.” Those who know Shelley only as the most exquisite of lyric poets will find that this essay will increase enormously their respect for his intellectual power. In the essay “On the Tragedies of Shakespeare” Lamb utters some of the most penetrating criticism ever passed upon the tragedy of “King Lear,” and presses to an extreme his view of the inferiority of the stage to the study for the enjoyment of Shakespeare. Thackeray’s lecture on Swift is a fine example of the biographical essay, and may be compared with Carlyle’s estimate of Scott with interesting results. Both men deal more with character than style, and both care passionately for moral quality. Walt Whitman’s “Preface,” like his poems, stands by itself, the outspoken plea for an astounding extension of the limits of form and matter in poetry. His poems in the third volume of “English Poetry” in The Harvard Classics should be read in connection with this “Preface.” Sainte-Beuve is generally placed at the head of European criticism in the nineteenth century; and the two papers here given are good examples of his manner. Renan, one of the most eloquent of mod 

CRITICISM OF LITERATURE AND FINE ARTS 49 ern writers in any country, discourses on “The Poetry of the Celtic Races” to which he himself belonged. Mazzini, purest of patriots, is represented by a paper which shows his fine power of generalization and of taking large views. An Italian nationalist in feeling, Mazzini was continental in the range of his intellect. Taine’s famous “Introduction” expounds his formula for explaining the characteristics of a literature. Whatever objections may be raised to his theory, there is no question of the brilliance of the presentation. Few critical writings of our own day have influenced the study of poetry so much as this of Matthew Arnold’s. It is an excellent example of his style, and exhibits both the strength and the weakness of his critical thinking. “Sesame and Lilies” consists of two lectures, largely hortatory, but incidentally containing some notable criticism. Bagehot, best known as a writer on finance, appears here as a specimen of a strong nonliterary intellect applying itself to the discussion of a literary topic. At the opposite extreme is the paper in which Poe, a master of the technical side of his art, treats of what he regards as its essence. In three essays, Emerson discourses suggestively, if unsystematically, on “The Poet,” on “Beauty,” and on “Literature.” Finally, in Stevenson’s essay on “Samuel Pepys,” one of the most expert of literary craftsmen of modern times sketches the personality of the writer who wrote the most remarkable “Diary” in English Literature.

CLASS II (): the large variety of literary types represented in The Harvard Classics, only a few of the more prominent have been selected for classification here. Others stand already grouped in the volumes: for, example, the three volumes of English Poetry, along with the works of Milton and Burns, contain most of the Lyric Poetry in the collection; and the Prefaces regarded as independent documents, are in one volume. Still others, such as Allegory, Oratory, the Dialogue, occur in the lists made up according to subject matter; and readers interested in these as forms can easily collect them from the Tables of Contents and the General Index. A DRAMA In dramatic literature the palm of supremacy lies between Greece and England, and it is natural that these two countries should be most fully represented here. Both countries at a culminating point in their history expressed themselves in this form, and much of the intellectual and imaginative vitality of the Age of Pericles in Greece and the Age of Elizabeth in England can be apprehended from these dramas. Eight of the most distinguished masterpieces of the other countries of Europe have been added; so that the present list represents not unworthily the best in this form that the world has produced. These thirty-seven plays exhibit a great variety of dramatic form —classical and romantic tragedy, satirical and romantic comedy, chronicle history, masque, and cantata. No less varied are the themes; from gods to beggars all types of character appear, and every variety of human motive, human effort, and human suffering is shown. No other literary form could present in so few pages so just and so impressive a reflection of the pageant of human life. 51

B BIOGRAPHY AND LETTERS OST of the titles in this list have already been the subject M of comment; those that remain speak for themselves. Here are a number of records of actual human lives, all of them of notable people, chosen either for their representative or for their intrinsic value. Some of these records are by skilled biographers like Plutarch; in other cases, by letters, or confessions, or in set narratives, the story is told by the man himself; still others are summaries and estimates rather than detailed biographies. Perhaps the formal autobiographies are the most interesting and significant of all; and of these the personal revelations of St. Augustine, of Benvenuto Cellini, of Benjamin Franklin, and of John Stuart Mill stand in the first rank.

& ESSAYS she: is almost no limit to the variety of theme which may be treated in the essay, and few rules can be laid down to regulate its form. Montaigne, who may be said to have originated this type of literature, remains one of the greatest masters of it; and in the specimens from his work in the present list one can find the ease and grace and the pleasant flavor of personal intimacy which constitute much of its charm. A large proportion of these essays deal with books, and of these something has already been said in the section on Criticism. Some, like those of Milton, Swift, Defoe, Newman, and Huxley, fall also under the heading of Education. A few treat of political matters; such are those of Sydney Smith, Mill, and Lowell. Others, such as some of Montaigne’s, Ruskin’s, Carlyle’s, Emerson’s, and Stevenson’s, deal with matters of conduct, though not in the formal manner of the ethical philosopher. Bacon’s “Essays” are concerned with so great a variety of subjects that classification is difficult; but the largest group form a sort of handbook of the principles on which success in public life was achieved in his time. Yet these more severe themes are mingled with others of more charm, where he chats pleasantly on an ideal palace or garden, or on the contriving of courtly entertainments. Of all prose forms, the essay is that which gives most scope for pure expression of personality. Those in the present list which rank highest as essays do so, not by virtue of the weight of their opinions, or arguments, or information, but by the spontaneity with which the author gives utterance to his mood or fancy. Thus the delightful essay of Cowley “Of Agriculture” is hardly to be recommended as a guide to farming; but as a quarter of an hour of graceful conversation it is charming. Hazlitt, Leigh Hunt, Lamb, De Quincey, 55

56 READER'S GUIDE Thoreau, and Stevenson (in “Truth of Intercourse”) all exhibit this individual quality, and reveal personalities of different kinds and degrees of attractiveness, but none without a high degree of interest.

D NARRATIVE POETRY AND PROSE FICTION professes to be the literature of entertainment. All these titles belong to works which are in the first place good stories; and most of them have lived largely by virtue of this quality. They come from all centuries within the historic period, and from all the countries within our range. They deal with war and peace, love and hate, gods and men and animals, angels and demons, historic fact, modern observation, and pure fancy; some mean no more than they seem to—simple tales of the action and suffering of men; others carry mystical significations hidden under the surface. But, though they may profess no more than a power to entertain, they, in fact, do far more for us. Each of these tales, in proportion to its truth to human nature and the effectiveness with which it is told, helps to make us more fully acquainted with our kind, broadens our sympathies, deepens our insight, serves us, in fact, as a kind of experience obtained at second hand. No less than the most weighty philosophy or the most informing history or science, then, do these stories in prose and poetry deserve their place among the essential instruments of mental and moral culture.

EXPLANATORY NOTE ON GENERAL INDEX Titles of books, essays, dramas, poems, etc., are indexed under the significant subject word where there is one (as Trutn, Essay ON, Bacon’s. ImMMoRTALITY, ODE ON INTIMATIONS OF). Where there is no principal subject word, the title 1s indexed in its proper order, omitting initial articles, prepositions, or interjections (Harp THat Once TuHroucH Tara’s Hats, THE). Titles of works included in The Harvard Classics are entered in small capitals (7EnNrw, THE). Works discussed in the Classics, but not included therein, are entered in italics (Percy's Reliques), and will be found as a rule only as subtitles under the author's name. Where the author is unknown or uncertain, or where there is a multiple authorship, the work is entered under its own title. Titles of many poems are merely the first lines repeated. The exact titles of such poems will therefore be found in the InvEx TO THE First Lines oF Poems, Soncs, CHorusEs, HyMNs AND Psatms.
