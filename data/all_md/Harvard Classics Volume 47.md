INTRODUCTORY NOTE THomas Dexker’s career is an extreme instance of the hazardous life led by the professional author in the time of Shakespeare. Born in London about 1570, Dekker first appears certainly as a dramatist about 1598, when we find him working on plays in collaboration with other dramatists in the pay of the manager, Henslowe. He wrote, in partnership or alone, many dramas; and when the market for these was dull he turned to the writing of entertainments, occasional verses, and prose pamphlets on a great variety of subjects. But all his activity seems to have failed to - supply a decent livelihood, for he was often in prison for debt, at one time for a period of three years; and most of the biographical details about him which have come down to us are connected with borrowing money or getting into jail or out of it. He disappears from view in the thirties of the seventeenth century. “The Shoemaker’s Holiday,” first acted in 1599, is a good example of Dekker’s work in the drama. The story is taken from Thomas Deloney’s “Gentle Craft,” and gives an opportunity for a picture of life among the trades-people of London at a period when the frequency in the drama of Italian Dukes and Cardinals is liable to make us forget that, in spite of vice and frivolity in high places, the world was still kept going by decent work-people who attended to their business. The play is full of an atmosphere of pleasant mirth, varied with characteristic touches of pathos; and it contains in the figure of Simon Eyre a creation of marked individuality and hilarious humor. It is striking that the most highspirited picture of London life in the time of Elizabeth should come from the pen of the author who seems to have been more hardly treated by fortune than any of his contemporaries.

[A street in London] Enter the Lorp Mayor and the Earu or LIncoLn Lincoln Y lord mayor, you have sundry times Feasted myself and many courtiers more; Seldom or never can we be so kind To make requital of your courtesy. But leaving this, I hear my cousin Lacy Is much affected to’ your daughter Rose. L. Mayor. True, my good lord, and she loves him so well That I mislike her boldness in the chase. Lincoln. Why, my lord mayor, think you it then a shame, To join a Lacy with an Oateley’s name? L. Mayor. Too mean is my poor girl for his high birth; _ Poor citizens must not with courtiers wed, 1In love with. 469 \

470 THOMAS DEKKER Who will in silks and gay apparel spend More in one year than I am worth, by far: Therefore your honour need not doubt’ my girl. Lincoln. Take heed, my lord, advise you what you do! A verier unthrift lives not in the world, Than is my cousin; for I'll tell you what: "Tis now almost a year since he requested To travel countries for experience. I furnished him with coins, bills of exchange, Letters of credit, men to wait on him, Solicited my friends in Italy Well to respect him. But to see the end: Scant had he journey’d through half Germany, But all his coin was spent, his men cast off, His bills embezzl’d,* and my jolly coz,* Asham’d to show his bankrupt presence here, Became a shoemaker in Wittenberg, A goodly science for a gentleman Of such descent! Now judge the rest by this: Suppose your daughter have a thousand pound, He did consume me more in one half year; And make him heir to all the wealth you have One twelvemonth’s rioting will waste it all. Then seek, my lord, some honest citizen To wed your daughter to. L. Mayor. I thank your lordship. [ Aside.] Well, fox, I understand your subtilty— As for your nephew, let your lordship’s eye But watch his actions, and you need not fear, For I have sent my daughter far enough. And yet your cousin Rowland might do well, Now he hath learn’d an occupation; And yet I scorn to call him son-in-law. Lincoln, Ay, but I have a better trade for him. I thank his grace, he hath appointed him 2Fear. % Wasted. *Cousin; used of any relative not of one’s immediate family.

See where he comes!— Enter Lovett, Lacy, and Askew Lovell, what news with you? Lovell. My Lord of Lincoln, ’tis his highness’ will, That presently’ your cousin ship for France With all his powers; he would not for a million, But they should land at Dieppe within four days. Lincoln. Go certify his grace, it shall be done. Exit Lovet. Now, cousin Lacy, in what forwardness Are all your companies? Lacy. All well prepared. The men of Hertfordshire lie at Mile-end, Suffolk and Essex train in Tothill-fields, The Londoners and those of Middlesex, All gallantly prepar’d in Finsbury, With frolic spirits long for their parting hour. L. Mayor. They have their imprest,’ coats, and furniture;’ And, if it please your cousin Lacy come To the Guildhall, he shall receive his pay; And twenty pounds besides my brethren Will freely give him, to approve our loves We bear unto my lord, your uncle here. Lacy. I thank your honour. Lincoln. Thanks, my good lord mayor. L. Mayor. At the Guildhall we will expect your coming. Exit. Lincoln. To approve your loves to me? No subtilty! Nephew, that twenty pound he doth bestow For joy to rid you from his daughter Rose. But, cousins both, now here are none but friends, I would not have you cast an amorous eye Upon so mean a project as the love 5 At once. Regimental badge. 4 Equipment.

472 THOMAS DEKKER Of a gay, wanton, painted citizen. I know, this churl even in the height of scorn Doth hate the mixture of his blood with thine. I pray thee, do thou so! Remember, coz, What honourable fortunes wait on thee. Increase the king’s love, which so brightly shines, And gilds thy hopes. I have no heir but thee,— And yet not thee, if with a wayward spirit Thou start from the true bias® of my love. Lacy. My lord, I will for honour, not desire Of land or livings, or to be your heir, So guide my actions in pursuit of France, As shall add glory to the Lacys’ name. Lincoln. Coz, for those words here’s thirty Portuguese, And, nephew Askew, there’s a few for you. Fair Honour, in her loftiest eminence, Stays in France for you, till you fetch her thence. Then, nephews, clap swift wings on your designs. Begone, begone, make haste to the Guildhall; There presently I'll meet you. Do not stay: Where honour beckons, shame attends delay. Askew. How gladly would your uncle have you gone! Lacy. True, coz, but I'll o’erreach his policies. I have some serious business for three days, Which nothing but my presence can dispatch. You, therefore, cousin, with the companies, Shall haste to Dover; there I'll meet with you: Or, if I stay past my prefixed time, Away for France; we'll meet in Normandy. The twenty pounds my lord mayor gives to me You shall receive, and these ten Portuguese, Part of mine uncle’s thirty. Gentle coz, Have care to our great charge; I know, your wisdom Hath tried itself in higher consequence. Askew. Coz, all myself am yours: yet have this care, To lodge in London with all secrecy; Inclination. 9A gold coin, worth about three pounds twelve shillings. Exit

THE SHOEMAKER’S HOLIDAY 473 Our uncle Lincoln hath, besides his own, Many a jealous eye, that in your face Stares only to watch means for your disgrace. Lacy. Stay, cousin, who be these? Enter Simon Eyre, Marcery his wife, Hones, Firx, JANE, and RaLpH with a piece’ Eyre. Leave whining, leave whining! Away with this whimpering, this puling, these blubbering tears, and these wet eyes! I'll get thy husband discharg’d, I warrant thee, sweet Jane; go to! Hodge. Master, here be the captains. Eyre. Peace, Hodge; hush, ye knave, hush! Firk. Here be the cavaliers and the colonels, master. Eyre. Peace, Firk; peace, my fine Firk! Stand by with your pishery-pashery,” away! I am a man of the best presence; I’ll speak to them, an” they were Popes.—Gentlemen, captains, colonels, commanders! Brave men, brave leaders, may it please you to give me audience. I am Simon Eyre, the mad shoemaker of Tower Street; this wench with the mealy mouth that will never tire, is my wife, I can tell you; here’s Hodge, my man and my foreman; here’s Firk, my fine firking’ journeyman, and this is blubbered Jane. All we come to be suitors for this honest Ralph. Keep him at home, and as I am a true shoemaker and a gentleman of the gentle craft, buy spurs yourselves, and I'll find ye boots these seven years. Marg. Seven years, husband? Eyre. Peace, midriff,"* peace! I know what I do. Peace! Firk. Truly, master cormorant,” you shall do God good service to let Ralph and his wife stay together. She’s a young new-married woman; if you take her husband away from her a-night, you undo her; she may beg in the daytime; for he’s as good a workman at a prick and an awl, as any is in our trade. Jane. O let him stay, else I shall be undone. Firk. Ay, truly, she shall be laid at one side like a pair of old _ shoes else, and be occupied for no use. Lacy. Truly, my friends, it lies not in my power: 10Piece of leather. 1! Twiddle-twaddle. If. %%Frisky, tricky. 44 Used as a term of contempt. 15 Quibbling on colonel.

474 THOMAS DEKKER The Londoners are press’d,” paid, and set forth By the lord mayor; I cannot change a man. Hodge. Why, then you were as good be a corporal as a colonel, if you cannot discharge one good fellow; and I tell you true, I think you do more than you can answer, to press a man within a year and a day of his marriage. Eyre. Well said, melancholy Hodge; gramercy, my fine foreman. Marg. Truly, gentlemen, it were ill done for such as you, to stand so stifly against a poor young wife, considering her case, she is newmarried, but let that pass. I pray, deal not roughly with her; her husband is a young man, and but newly ent’red, but let that pass. Eyre. Away with your pishery-pashery, your pols and your edipols!*7 Peace, midriff; silence, Cicely Bumtrinket! Let your head speak. Firk. Yea, and the horns too, master. Eyre. ‘Too soon, my fine Firk, too soon! Peace, scoundrels! See you this man? Captains, you will not release him? Well, let him go; he’s a proper shot; let him vanish! Peace, Jane, dry up thy tears, they’ll make his powder dankish."* Take him, brave men; Hector of Troy was an hackney to him, Hercules and Termagant” scoundrels, Prince Arthur’s Round-table—by the Lord of Ludgate—ne’er fed such a tall, such a dapper swordsman; by the life of Pharaoh, a brave, resolute swordsman! Peace, Jane! I say no more, mad knaves. Firk. See, see, Hodge, how my master raves in commendation of Ralph! Hodge. Ralph, th’art a gull,” by this hand, an thou goest not. Askew. 1 am glad, good Master Eyre, it is my hap To meet so resolute a soldier. Trust me, for your report and love to him, A common slight regard shall not respect him. Lacy. Is thy name Ralph?

I will not have thee strike thy gimlet into these weak vessels; prick thine enemies, Ralph. Enter DopcER Dodger. My lord, your uncle on the Tower-hill Stays with the lord mayor and the aldermen, And doth request you with all speed you may, To hasten thither. Askew. Cousin, let’s go. Lacy. Dodger, run you before, tell them we come.— This Dodger is mine uncle’s parasite, Exit DopcEr. The arrant’st varlet that e’er breath’d on earth; He sets more discord in a noble house By one day’s broaching of his pickthank tales,” Than can be salv’d” again in twenty years, And he, I fear, shall go with us to France, To pry into our actions. Askew. Therefore, coz, It shall behove you to be circumspect. Lacy. Fear not, good cousin.—Ralph, hie to your colours. [Exit Lacy and AsxKeEw.|] Ralph. 1 must, because there’s no remedy; But, gentle master and my loving dame, As you have always been a friend to me, So in mine absence think upon my wife. Jane. Alas, my Ralph. Marg. She cannot speak for weeping. Eyre. Peace, you crack’d groats,* you mustard tokens,” disquiet not the brave soldier. Go thy ways, Ralph! Jane.

476 THOMAS DEKKER Eyre. Let me see thy hand, Jane. This fine hand, this white hand, these pretty fingers must spin, must card, must work; work, you bombast-cotton-candle-quean; work for your living, with a pox to you.—Hold thee, Ralph, here’s five sixpences for thee; fight for the honour of the gentle craft, for the gentlemen shoemakers, the courageous cordwainers, the flower of St. Martin’s, the mad knaves of Bedlam, Fleet Street, Tower Street and Whitechapel; crack me the crowns of the French knaves; a pox on them, crack them; fight, by the Lord of Ludgate; fight, my fine boy! Firk. Here, Ralph, here’s three twopences: two carry into France, the third shall wash our souls at parting, for sorrow is dry. For my sake, firk the Basa mon cues. Hodge. Ralph, I am heavy at parting; but here’s a shilling for thee. God send” thee to cram thy slops*® with French crowns, and thy enemies’ bellies with bullets. Ralph. I thank you, master, and I thank you all. Now, gentle wife, my loving lovely Jane, Rich men, at parting, give their wives rich gifts, Jewels and rings, to grace their lily hands. Thou know’st our trade makes rings for women’s heels: Here take this pair of shoes, cut out by Hodge, Stitch’d by my fellow Firk, seam’d by myself, Made up and pink’d” with letters for thy name. Wear them, my dear Jane, for thy husband’s sake, And every morning, when thou pull’st them on, Remember me, and pray for my return. Make much of them; for I have made them so That I can know them from a thousand mo. Drum sounds. Enter the Lorp Mayor, the Eart or Lincoin, Lacy, Askew, Doncer, and Soldiers. They pass over the stage; RALPH falls in amongst them; Firx and the rest cry “Farewell,” etc., and so exeunt. 25Grant. 6 Breeches (-pockets). ? Perforated.

THE SHOEMAKER’S HOLIDAY 477 ACT II ScenE I. [A garden at Old Ford] Enter Rost, alone, making a garland Rose. Here sit thou down upon this flow’ry bank, And make a garland for thy Lacy’s head. These pinks, these roses, and these violets, These blushing gilliflowers, these marigolds, The fair embroidery of his coronet, Carry not half such beauty in their cheeks, As the sweet countenance of my Lacy doth. O my most unkind father! O my stars, Why lower’d you so at my nativity, To make me love, yet live robb’d of my love? Here as a thief am I imprisoned For my dear Lacy’s sake within those walls, Which by my father’s cost were builded up For better purposes. Here must I languish For him that doth as much lament, I know, Mine absence, as for him I pine in woe. Enter Sypiu Sybil. Good morrow, young mistress. I am sure you make that garland for me; against’ I shall be Lady of the Harvest. Rose. Sybil, what news at London? Sybil. None but good; my lord mayor, your father, and master Philpot, your uncle, and Master Scot, your cousin, and Mistress Frigbottom by Doctors’ Commons, do all, by my troth, send you most hearty commendations. Rose. Did Lacy send kind greetings to his love? Sybil. O yes, out of cry, by my troth. I scant knew him; here _’a wore a scarf; and here a scarf, here a bunch of feathers, and here precious stones and jewels, and a pair of garters,—O, monstrous! like one of our yellow silk curtains at home here in Old Ford House here, in Master Belly-mount’s chamber. I stood at our door in 1In preparation.

478 THOMAS DEKKER Cornhill, look’d at him, he at me indeed, spake to him, but he not to me, not a word; marry go-up, thought I, with a wanion!* He passed by me as proud—Marry foh! are you grown humorous,’ thought I; and so shut the door, and in I came. Rose. O Sybil, how dost thou my Lacy wrong! My Rowland is as gentle as a lamb. No dove was ever half so mild as he. Sybil. Mild? yea, as a bushel of stamped crabs.* He looked upon me as sour as verjuice.’ Go thy ways, thought I; thou may’st be much in my gaskins,° but nothing in my nether-stocks.’ This is your fault, mistress, to love him that loves not you; he thinks scorn to do as he’s done to; but if I were as you, I’d cry, ‘Go by, Jeronimo, go by!’*® I’d set mine old debts against my new driblets, And the hare’s foot against the goose giblets, For if ever I sigh, when sleep I should take, Pray God I may lose my maidenhead when I wake. Rose. Will my love leave me then, and go to France? Sybil. I know not that, but I am sure I see him stalk before the soldiers. By my troth, he is a proper man; but he is proper that proper doth. Let him go snick-up,’ young mistress. Rose. Get thee to London, and learn perfectly Whether my Lacy go to France, or no. Do this, and I will give thee for thy pains My cambric apron and my Romish gloves, My purple stockings and a stomacher. Say, wilt thou do this, Sybil, for my sake? Sybil. Will I, quoth’a? At whose suit? By my troth, yes, I'll go. A cambric apron, gloves, a pair of purple stockings, and a stomacher! I'll sweat in purple, mistress, for you; I'll take anything that comes a’ God’s name. O rich! a cambric apron! Faith, then have at ‘up tails all’ I'll go jiggy-joggy to London, and be here in a trice, young mistress. Exit. 2 With a vengeance. *Capricious. 4 Crushed crab apples. 5 Juice of green fruits. 6 Wide trousers. 7 Stockings. ‘The meaning seems to be that though we may be acquainted we are not intimate friends. ®A phrase from Kyd’s Spanish Tragedy. ®Go and be hanged!

[A street in London] Enter Lacy, disguised as a Dutch Shoemaker Lacy. How many shapes have gods and kings devis’d, Thereby to compass their desired loves! It is no shame for Rowland Lacy, then, To clothe his cunning with the gentle craft, That, thus disguis’d, I may unknown possess The only happy presence of my Rose. For her have I forsook my charge in France, Incurr’d the king’s displeasure, and stirr’d up Rough hatred in mine uncle Lincoln’s breast. O love, how powerful art thou, that canst change High birth to baseness, and a noble mind To the mean semblance of a shoemaker! But thus it must be. For her cruel father, Hating the single union of our souls, Has secretly convey’d my Rose from London, To bar me of her presence; but I trust, Fortune and this disguise will further me Once more to view her beauty, gain her sight. Here in Tower Street with Eyre the shoemaker Mean I a while to work; I know the trade, I learnt it when I was in Wittenberg. Then cheer thy hoping spirits, be not dismay’d, Thou canst not want: do Fortune what she can, The gentle craft is living for a man. Exit. Scene III.

Have you drunk this morning that your throat is so clear? | Eyre. Ah, well said, Firk; well said, Firk. To work, my fine knave, to work! Wash thy face, and thou’t be more blest. Firk. Let them wash my face that will eat it. Good master, send for a souse-wife,’ if you’ll have my face cleaner. Enter Hopcr Eyre. Away, sloven! avaunt, scoundrel!—Good-morrow, Hodge; good-morrow, my fine foreman. Hodge. O master, good-morrow; y’are an early stirrer. Here’s a fair morning —Good-morrow, Firk, I could have slept this hour. Here’s a brave day towards.* Eyre. Oh, haste to work, my fine foreman, haste to work. Firk. Master, I am dry as dust to hear my fellow Roger talk of fair weather; let us pray for good leather, and let clowns and ploughboys and those that work in the fields pray for brave days. We work in a dry shop; what care I if it rain? Enter MarcEry Eyre. How now, Dame Margery, can you see to rise? Trip and go, call up the drabs, your maids. Marg. See to rise?

Call the quean up; if my men want shoe-thread, I'll swinge her in a stirrup. Firk. Yet, that’s but a dry beating; here’s still a sign of drought. Enter Lacy disguised, singing Lacy.

Eyre. Peace, Firk! A hard world! Let him pass, let him vanish; we have journeymen enow. Peace, my fine Firk! Marg. Nay, nay, y’are best follow your man’s counsel; you shall see what will come on’t. We have not men enow, but we must entertain every butter-box;” but let that pass. Hodge. Dame, ’fore God, if my master follow your counsel, he'll consume little beef. He shall be glad of men an he can catch them. Firk. Ay, that he shall. Hodge. ’Fore God, a proper man, and I warrant, a fine workman.

Bring him, quoth you? Here’s no knavery, to bring my master to buy a ship worth the lading of two or three hundred thousand pounds. Alas, that’s nothing; a trifle, a bauble, Hodge. Hodge. The truth is, Firk, that the merchant owner of the ship dares not shew his head, and therefore this skipper that deals for him, for the love he bears to Hans, offers my master Eyre a bargain in the commodities. He shall have a reasonable day of payment; he may sell the wares by that time, and be an huge gainer himself. Firk. Yea, but can my fellow Hans lend my master twenty porpentines as an earnest penny?

Ralph. 1 am glad to see you well, and I rejoice To hear that God hath blest my master so Since my departure. Marg. Yea, truly, Ralph, I thank my Maker; but let that pass. Hodge. And, sirrah Ralph, what news, what news in France? Ralph. Tell me, good Roger, first, what news in England? How does my Jane? When didst thou see my wife? Where lives my poor heart? She'll be poor indeed, Now I want limbs to get whereon to feed. Hodge. Limbs? Hast thou not hands, man? Thou shalt never see a shoemaker want bread, though he have but three fingers on a hand. Ralph. Yet all this while I hear not of my Jane. Marg. O Ralph, your wife,—perdy, we know not what’s become of her. She was here a while, and because she was married, grew more stately than became her; I checked her, and so forth; away she flung, never returned, nor said bye nor bah; and, Ralph, you know, ‘ka me, ka thee.’’ And so, as I tell ye——Roger, is not Firk come yet? Hodge. No, forsooth. Marg. And so, indeed, we heard not of her, but I hear she lives in London; but let that pass. If she had wanted, she might have opened her case to me or my husband, or to any of my men; I am sure, there’s not any of them, perdy, but would have done her good to his power. Hans, look if Firk be come. Hans. Yaw, tk sal, vro. Exit Hans. Marg. And so, as I said—but, Ralph, why dost thou weep? Thou knowest that naked we came out of our mother’s womb, and naked we must return; and, therefore, thank God for all things. Hodge. No, faith, Jane is a stranger here; but, Ralph, pull up a good heart, I know thou hast one. Thy wife, man, is in London; one 7 Scratch me, and I’ll scratch thee. 8 Yes, I shall, dame!

500 THOMAS DEKKER told me, he saw her a while ago very brave’ and neat; we'll ferret her out, an London hold her. Marg. Alas, poor soul, he’s overcome with sorrow; he does but as I do, weep for the loss of any good thing. But, Ralph, get thee in, call for some meat and drink, thou shalt find me worshipful towards thee. Ralph. 1 thank you, dame; since I want limbs and lands, I'll trust to God, my good friends, and my hands. Exit. Enter Hans and Firk running Firk. Run, good Hans! O Hodge, O mistress! Hodge, heave up thine ears; mistress, smug up’ your looks; on with your best apparel; my master is chosen, my master is called, nay, condemned by the cry of the country to be sheriff of the city for this famous year now to come. And time now being, a great many men in black gowns were asked for their voices and their hands, and my master had all their fists about his ears presently, and they cried “Ay, ay, ay, ay,—and so I came away— Wherefore without all other grieve I do salute you, Mistress Shrieve,” Hans. Yaw, my mester is de groot man, de shrieve. Hodge. Did not I tell you, mistress? Now I may boldly say: Good-morrow to your worship. Marg. Good-morrow, good Roger. I thank you, my good people all—Firk, hold up thy hand: here’s a three-penny piece for thy tidings. Firk. "Tis but three-half-pence, I think. Yes, ’tis three-pence, I smell the rose.” Hodge. But, mistress, be rul’d by me, and do not speak so pulingly. Firk. ’Tis her worship speaks so, and not she. No, faith, mistress, speak me in the old key: “To it, Firk,’ ‘there, good Firk,’ ‘ply your business, Hodge,’ ‘Hodge, with a full mouth,’ ‘I'll fill your bellies with good cheer, till they cry twang.’ 9Fine. °Brighten up. 1! Sheriff. 12“The three-farthing silver pieces of Queen Elizabeth had the profile of the sovereign with a rose at the back of her head.” —Dyce.

THE SHOEMAKER’S HOLIDAY 501 Enter Eyre wearing a gold chain Hans. See, myn liever broder, heer compt my meester. Marg. Welcome home, Master Shrieve; I pray God continue you in health and wealth. Eyre. See here, my Maggy, a chain, a gold chain for Simon Eyre. I shall make thee a lady; here’s a French hood for thee; on with it, on with it! dress thy brows with this flap of a shoulder of mutton, to make thee look lovely. Where be my fine men? Roger, I’ll make over my shop and tools to thee; Firk, thou shalt be the foreman; Hans, thou shalt have an hundred for twenty.” Be as mad knaves as your master Sim Eyre hath been, and you shall live to be Sheriffs of London—How dost thou like me, Margery? Prince am I none, yet am I princely born. Firk, Hodge, and Hans! All Three. Ay forsooth, what says your worship, Master Sheriff? Eyre. Worship and honour, you Babylonian knaves, for the gentle craft. But I forgot myself, 1 am bidden by my lord mayor to dinner to Old Ford; he’s gone before, I must after. Come, Madge, on with your trinkets! Now, my true Trojans, my fine Firk, my dapper Hodge, my honest Hans, some device, some odd crotchets, some morris, or such like, for the honour of the gentlemen shoemakers. Meet me at Old Ford, you know my mind. Come, Madge, away. Shut up the shop, knaves, and make holiday. Exeunt. Firk. O rare! O brave! Come, Hodge; follow me, Hans; We'll be with them for a morris-dance. Exeunt. Scene V. [A room at Old Ford| Enter the Lorp Mayor, |Rosz,] Eyre, Marcrry in a French houd, SysiL, and other Servants L. Mayor. Trust me, you are as welcome to Old Ford As I myself. Marg. Truly, I thank your lordship. L. Mayor. Would our bad cheer were worth the thanks you give. 13 See, my dear brothers, here comes my master. 14 The flap of a hood trimmed with fur or sheep’s wool.—RAys. 15 7, ¢., for the twenty Portuguese previously lent.

502 THOMAS DEKKER Eyre. Good cheer, my lord mayor, fine cheer! A fine house, fine walls, all fine and neat. L. Mayor. Now, by my troth, I'll tell thee, Master Eyre, It does me good, and all my brethren, That such a madcap fellow as thyself Is ent’red into our society. Marg. Ay, but, my lord, he must learn now to put on gravity. Eyre. Peace, Maggy, a fig for gravity! When I go to Guildhall in my scarlet gown, I'll look as demurely as a saint, and speak as gravely as a justice of peace; but now I am here at Old Ford, at my good lord mayor’s house, let it go by, vanish, Maggy, I’ll be merry; away with flip-flap, these fooleries, these gulleries. What, honey? Prince am I none, yet am I princely born. What says my lord mayor? L. Mayor. Ha, ha, ha! I had rather than a thousand pounds, I had an heart but half so light as yours. Eyre. Why, what should I do, my lord? A pound of care pays not a dram of debt. Hum, let’s be merry, whiles we are young; old age, sack and sugar will steal upon us, ere we be aware. Tue First Turee-MeEn’s Sonc O the month of May, the merry month of May, So frolick, so gay, and so green, so green, so green! O, and then did I unto my true love say: “Sweet Peg, thou shalt be my summer’s queen! “Now the nightingale, the pretty nightingale, The sweetest singer in all the forest’s choir, Entreats thee, sweet Peggy, to hear thy true love’s tale; Lo, yonder she sitteth, her breast against a brier. “But O, I spy the cuckoo, the cuckoo, the cuckoo; See where she sitteth: come away, my joy; Come away, I prithee: I do not like the cuckoo Should sing where my Peggy and I kiss and toy.” O the month of May, the merry month of May, So frolick, so gay, and so green, so green, so green!

THE SHOEMAKER’S HOLIDAY 503 And then did I unto my true love say: “Sweet Peg, thou shalt be my summer’s queen!” L. Mayor. It’s well done; Mistress Eyre, pray, give good counsel To my daughter. Marg. I hope, Mistress Rose will have the grace to take nothing that’s bad. L. Mayor. Pray God she do; for i’ faith, Mistress Eyre, I would bestow upon that peevish girl A thousand marks more than I mean to give her Upon condition she’d be rul’d by me. The ape still crosseth me. There came of late A proper gentleman of fair revenues, Whom gladly I would call son-in-law: But my fine cockney would have none of him. You'll prove a coxcomb for it, ere you die: A courtier, or no man must please your eye. Eyre. Be rul’d, sweet Rose: th’art ripe for a man. Marry not with a boy that has no more hair on his face than thou hast on thy cheeks. A courtier, wash, go by, stand not upon pishery-pashery: those silken fellows are but painted images, outsides, outsides, Rose; their inner linings are torn. No, my fine mouse, marry me with a gentleman grocer like my lord mayor, your father; a grocer is a sweet trade: plums, plums. Had I a son or daughter should marry out of the generation and blood of the shoemakers, he should pack; what, the gentle trade is a living for a man through Europe, through the world. A noise within of a tabor and a pipe. L. Mayor. What noise is this? Eyre. O my lord mayor, a crew of good fellows that for love to your honour are come hither with a morris-dance. Come in, my Mesopotamians, cheerily. Enter Honcz, Hans, Ratpu, Fir, and other Shoemakers, in a morris; after a little dancing the Lorpv Mayor speaks. L. Mayor. Master Eyre, are all these shoemakers? Eyre. All cordwainers, my good lord mayor. Rose. { Aside.] How like my Lacy looks yond shoemaker!

504 THOMAS DEKKER Hans. | Aside.] O that I durst but speak unto my love! L. Mayor. Sybil, go fetch some wine to make these drink. You are all welcome. All. We thank your lordship. Rose takes a cup of wine and goes to Hans. Rose. For his sake whose fair shape thou represent’st, Good friend, I drink to thee. Hans. Ic bedancke, good frister.' Marg. I see, Mistress Rose, you do not want judgment; you have drunk to the properest man I keep. Firk. Here be some have done their parts to be as proper as he. L. Mayor. Well, urgent business calls me back to London. Good fellows, first go in and taste our cheer; And to make merry as you homeward go, Spend these two angels in beer at Stratford-Bow. Eyre. 'To these two, my mad lads, Sim Eyre adds another; then cheerily, Firk; tickle it, Hans, and all for the honour of shoemakers. All go dancing out. L. Mayor. Come, Master Eyre, let’s have your company. Exeunt. Rose. Sybil, what shall I do? Sybil. Why, what’s the matter? Rose. That Hans the shoemaker is my love Lacy, Disguis’d in that attire to find me out. How should I find the means to speak with him? Sybil. What, mistress, never fear; I dare venture my maidenhead to nothing, and that’s great odds, that Hans the Dutchman, when we come to London, shall not only see and speak with you, but in spite of all your father’s policies steal you away and marry you. Will not this please you? Rose. Do this, and ever be assured of my love. Sybil. Away, then, and follow your father to London, lest your absence cause him to suspect something: To-morrow, if my counsel be obey’d, I'll bind you prentice to the gentle trade. [ Exeunt. | 1] thank you, good maid!

THE SHOEMAKER’S HOLIDAY 505 ACT IV ScenE I. [A street in London] JANE in a Seamster’s shop, working; enter Master Hammon, muffled; he stands aloof Ham. Yonder’s the shop, and there my fair love sits. She’s fair and lovely, but she is not mine. O, would she were! Thrice have I courted her, Thrice hath my hand been moist’ned with her hand, Whilst my poor famish’d eyes do feed on that Which made them famish. I am unfortunate: I still love one, yet nobody loves me. I muse in other men what women see That I so want! Fine Mistress Rose was coy, And this too curious! Oh, no, she is chaste, And for she thinks me wanton, she denies To cheer my cold heart with her sunny eyes. How prettily she works, oh pretty hand! Oh happy work! It doth me good to stand Unseen to see her. Thus I oft have stood In frosty evenings, a light burning by her, Enduring biting cold, only to eye her. One only look hath seem’d as rich to me As a king’s crown; such is love’s lunacy. Muffled I'll pass along, and by that try Whether she know me. Jane. Sir, what is’t you buy? What is’t you lack, sir, calico, or lawn, Fine cambric shirts, or bands, what will you buy? Ham, | Aside.| That which thou wilt not sell. Faith, yet I'll try: How do you sell this handkerchief? Jane. Good cheap. Ham. And how these ruffs? Jane. Cheap too. Ham. And how this band? Jane. Cheap too.

506 THOMAS DEKKER Ham. All cheap; how sell you then this hand? Jane. My hands are not to be sold. Ham. To be given then! Nay, faith, I come to buy. Jane. But none knows when. Ham. Good sweet, leave work a little while; let’s play. Jane. I cannot live by keeping holiday. Ham. Ill pay you for the time which shall be lost. Jane. With me you shall not be at so much cost. Ham. Look, how you wound this cloth, so you wound me. Jane. It may be so. Ham. "Tis so. Jane. What remedy? Ham. Nay, faith, you are too coy. Jane. Let go my hand. Ham. 1 will do any task at your command, I would let go this beauty, were I not In mind to disobey you by a power That controls kings: I love you! Jane. So, now part. Ham. With hands I may, but never with my heart. In faith, I love you. Jane. I believe you do. Ham. Shall a true love in me breed hate in you? Jane. I hate you not. Ham. Then you must love? Jane. I do. What are you better now? I love not you. Ham. All this, I hope, is but a woman’s fray, That means, “Come to me,” when she cries, “Away!” In earnest, mistress, I do not jest, A true chaste love hath ent’red in my breast. I love you dearly, as I love my life, I love you as a husband loves a wife; That, and no other love, my love requires, Thy wealth, I know, is little; my desires Thirst not for gold. Sweet, beauteous Jane, what’s mine

THE SHOEMAKER’S HOLIDAY 507 Shall, if thou make myself thine, all be thine. Say, judge, what is thy sentence, life or death? Mercy or cruelty lies in thy breath. Jane. Good sir, I do believe you love me well; For ’tis a silly conquest, silly pride For one like you—I mean a gentleman— To boast that by his love-tricks he hath brought Such and such women to his amorous lure; I think you do not so, yet many do, And make it even a very trade to woo. I could be coy, as many women be, Feed you with sunshine smiles and wanton looks, But I detest witchcraft; say that I Do constantly believe, you constant have—— Ham. Why dost thou not believe me? Jane. I believe you; But yet, good sir, because I will not grieve you With hopes to taste fruit which will never fall, In simple truth this is the sum of all: My husband lives, at least, I hope he lives. Press’d was he to these bitter wars in France; Bitter they are to me by wanting him. I have but one heart, and that heart’s his due. How can I then bestow the same on you? Whilst he lives, his I live, be it ne’er so poor, And rather be his wife than a king’s whore. Ham. Chaste and dear woman, I will not abuse thee, Although it cost my life, if thou refuse me. Thy husband, press’d for France, what was his name? Jane. Ralph Damport. Ham. Damport P—Here’s a letter sent From France to me, from a dear friend of mine, A gentleman of place; here he doth write Their names that have been slain in every fight. Jane. 1 hope death’s scroll contains not my love’s name. Ham. Cannot you read? Jane. I can.

508 THOMAS DEKKER Ham. Peruse the same. To my remembrance such a name I read Amongst the rest. See here. Jane. Ay me, he’s dead! He’s dead! If this be true, my dear heart’s slain! Ham. Have patience, dear love. Jane. Hence, hence! Ham. Nay, sweet Jane, Make not poor sorrow proud with these rich tears. I mourn thy husband’s death, because thou mourn’st. Jane. That bill is forg’d; ’tis sign’d by forgery. Ham. I'll bring thee letters sent besides to many, Carrying the like report: Jane, ’tis too true. Come, weep not: mourning, though it rise from love, Helps not the mourned, yet hurts them that mourn. Jane. For God’s sake, leave me. Ham. Whither dost thou turn? Forget the dead, love them that are alive; His love is faded, try how mine will thrive. Jane. ’Tis now no time for me to think on love. Ham. "Tis now best time for you to think on love, Because your love lives not. Jane. Though he be dead, My love to him shall not be buried; For God’s sake, leave me to myself alone. Ham. ’Twould kill my soul, to leave thee drown’d in moan. Answer me to my suit, and I am gone; Say to me yea or no. Jane. No. Ham. Then farewell! One farewell will not serve, I come again; Come, dry these wet cheeks; tell me, faith, sweet Jane, Yea or no, once more. Jane. Once more I say: no; Once more be gone, I pray; else will I go. Ham. Nay, then I will grow rude, by this white hand, Until you change that cold “no”; here I'll stand

THE SHOEMAKER’S HOLIDAY 509 Till by your hard heart—— Jane. Nay, for God’s love, peace] My sorrows by your presence more increase. Not that you thus are present, but all grief Desires to be alone; therefore in brief Thus much I say, and saying bid adieu: If ever I wed man, it shall be you. Ham. O blessed voice! Dear Jane, I'll urge no more, Thy breath hath made me rich. Jane. Death makes me poor. Exeunt. Scene II. [London: a street before Hodge's shop] Hone, at his shop-board, Ratpu, Firx, Hans, and a Boy at work All. Hey, down a down, down derry. Hodge. Well said, my hearts; ply your work to-day, we loit’red yesterday; to it pell-mell, that we may live to be lord mayors, or aldermen at least. Firk. Hey, down a down, derry. Hodge. Well said, i’ faith! How say’st thou, Hans, doth not Firk tickle it? Hans. Yaw, mester. Firk. Not so neither, my organ-pipe squeaks this morning for want of liquoring. Hey, down a down, derry! Hans. Forward, Firk, tow best un jolly yongster. Hort, I, mester, ic bid yo, cut me un pair vampres vor Mester Jeffre’s boots.’ Hodge. Thou shalt, Hans. Firk. Master! Hodge. How now, boy? Firk. Pray, now you are in the cutting vein, cut me out a pair of counterfeits,” or else my work will not pass current; hey, down a down! Hodge. Tell me, sirs, are my cousin Mrs. Priscilla’s shoes done? 1“Forward, Firk, thou art a jolly youngster. Hark, ay, master, I pray you cut me a pair of vamps for Master Jeffrey’s boots.” Vamps are the upper leathers of a shoe. 2 Counterfeits sometimes means vamps.

510 THOMAS DEKKER Firk. Your cousin? No, master; one of your aunts, hang her; let them alone. Ralph. 1 am in hand with them; she gave charge that none but I should do them for her. Firk. Thou do for her? Then ’twill be a lame doing, and that she loves not. Ralph, thou might’st have sent her to me, in faith, I would have yearked and firked your Priscilla. Hey, down a down, derry. This gear will not hold. Hodge. How say’st thou, Firk, were we not merry at Old Ford? Firk. How, merry! Why, our buttocks went jiggy-joggy like a quagmire. Well, Sir Roger Oatmeal, if I thought all meal of that nature, I would eat nothing but bagpuddings. Ralph, Of all good fortunes my fellow Hans had the best. Firk. *Tis true, because Mistress Rose drank to him. Hodge. Well, well, work apace. They say, seven of the aldermen be dead, or very sick. Firk. I care not, I'll be none. Ralph. No, nor I; but then my Master Eyre will come quickly to be lord mayor. Enter Syst Firk. Whoop, yonder comes Sybil. Hodge. Sybil, welcome, i’faith; and how dost thou, mad wench? Firk. Sybil, welcome to London. Sybil. Godamercy, sweet Firk; good lord, Hodge, what a delicious shop you have got! You tickle it, i’faith. Ralph. Godamercy, Sybil, for our good cheer at Old Ford. Sybil. That you shall have, Ralph. Firk. Nay, by the mass, we had tickling cheer, Sybil; and how the plague dost thou and Mistress Rose and my lord mayor? I put the women in first. Sybil. Well, Godamercy; but God’s me, I forget ee where’s Hans the Fleming? Firk. Hark, butter-box, now you must yelp out some spreken. Hans. Wat begaie you? Vat vod you, Frister?* Sybil. Marry, you must come to my young mistress, to pull on her shoes you made last. 3 What do you want, what would you, girl?

THE SHOEMAKER’S HOLIDAY 511 Hans. Vare ben your egle fro, vare ben your mistris?* Sybil, Marry, here at our London house in Cornhill. Firk. Will nobody serve her turn but Hans? Sybil. No, sir. Come, Hans, I stand upon needles. Hodge. Why then, Sybil, take heed of pricking. Sybil. For that let me alone. I have a trick in my budget. Come, Hans. Hans. Yaw, yaw, ic sall meete yo gane. Exit Hans and Syst. Hodge. Go, Hans, make haste again. Come, who lacks work? Firk. I, master, for I lack my breakfast; ’tis munching-time, and past. Hodge. Ist so? Why, then leave work, Ralph. To breakfast! Boy, look to the tools. Come, Ralph; come, Firk. Exeunt. Scene III. [The same] Enter a Serving-man Serv. Let me see now, the sign of the Last in Tower Street. Mass, yonder’s the house. What, haw! Who’s within? _ Enter Ratpu Ralph. Who calls there? What want you, sir? Serv. Marry, I would have a pair of shoes made for a gentlewoman against to-morrow morning. What, can you do them? Ralph. Yes, sir, you shall have them. But what length’s her foot? Serv. Why, you must make them in all parts like this shoe; but, at any hand, fail not to do them, for the gentlewoman is to be married very early in the morning. Ralph. How? by this shoe must it be made? By this? Are you sure, sir, by this? Serv. How, by this? Am I sure, by this? Art thou in thy wits? I tell thee, I must have a pair of shoes, dost thou mark me? A pair of shoes, two shoes, made by this very shoe, this same shoe, against to-morrow morning by four a clock. Dost understand me? Canst thou do’t? 4 Where is your noble lady, where is your mistress? > Yes, yes, I shall go with you.

512 THOMAS DEKKER Ralph. Yes, sir, yes—I—I—I can do’t. By this shoe, you say? I should know this shoe. Yes, sir, yes, by this shoe, I can do’t. Four a clock, well. Whither shall I bring them? Serv. To the sign of the Golden Ball in Watling Street; enquire for one Master Hammon, a gentleman, my master. Ralph. Yea, sir; by this shoe, you say? Serv. I say, Master Hammon at the Golden Ball; he’s the bridegroom, and those shoes are for his bride. Ralph. They shall be done by this shoe. Well, well, Master Hammon at the Golden Shoe—I would say, the Golden Ball; very well, very well. But I pray you, sir, where must Master Hammon be married? Serv. At Saint Faith’s Church, under Paul’s. But what’s that to thee? Prithee, dispatch those shoes, and so farewell. Exit. Ralph. By this shoe, said he. How am I amaz’d At this strange accident! Upon my life, This was the very shoe I gave my wife, When I was press’d for France; since when, alas! I never could hear of her. It is the same, And Hammon’s bride no other but my Jane. Enter Firk Firk. ’Snails.'' Ralph, thou hast lost thy part of three pots, a countryman of mine gave me to breakfast. Ralph. I care not; I have found a better thing. Firk. A thing? Away! Is it a man’s thing, or a woman s thing? Ralph. Firk, dost thou know this shoe? Firk. No, by my troth; neither doth that know me! I have no acquaintance with it, ’tis a mere stranger to me. Ralph. Why, then I do; this shoe, I durst be sworn, Once covered the instep of my Jane. This is her size, her breadth, thus trod my love; These true-love knots I pricked. I hold my life, By this old shoe I shall find out my wife. Firk. Ha, ha! Old shoe, that wert new! How a murrain came this ague-fit of foolishness upon thee? 1A corruption of “God's nails.” |

THE SHOEMAKER’S HOLIDAY 513 Ralph. Thus, Firk: even now here came a serving-man; By this shoe would he have a new pair made Against to-morrow morning for his mistress, That’s to be married to a gentleman. And why may not this be my sweet Jane? Firk. And why may’st not thou be my sweet ass? Ha, ha! Ralph. Well, laugh and spare not! But the truth is this: Against to-morrow morning I'll provide A lusty crew of honest shoemakers, ‘To watch the going of the bride to church. If she prove Jane, I’ll take her in despite From Hammon and the devil, were he by. If it be not my Jane, what remedy? Hereof I am sure, I shall live till I die, Although I never with a woman lie. Exit. Firk. Thou lie with a woman to build nothing but Cripple-gates! Well, God sends fools fortune, and it may be, he may light upon his matrimony by such a device; for wedding and hanging goes by destiny. Exit. Scene IV. [London: a room in the Lord Mayor's house] Enter Hans and Ross, arm in arm Hans. How happy am I by embracing thee! Oh, I did fear such cross mishaps did reign, That I should never see my Rose again. Rose. Sweet Lacy, since fair opportunity Offers herself to further our escape, Let not too over-fond esteem of me Hinder that happy hour. Invent the means, And Rose will follow thee through all the world. Hans. Oh, how I surfeit with excess of joy, Made happy by thy rich perfection! _ But since thou pay’st sweet interest to my hopes, Redoubling love on love, let me once more Like to a bold-fac’d debtor crave of thee, This night to steal abroad, and at Eyre’s house,

514 THOMAS DEKKER Who now by death of certain aldermen Is mayor of London, and my master once, Meet thou thy Lacy, where in spite of change, Your father’s anger, and mine uncle’s hate, Our happy nuptials will we consummate. Enter Sypiu Sybil. Oh God, what will you do, mistress? Shift for yourself, your father is at hand! He’s coming, he’s coming! Master Lacy, hide yourself in my mistress! For God’s sake, shift for yourselves! Hans. Your father come, sweet Rose—what shall I do? Where shall I hide me? How shall I escape? Rose. A man, and want wit in extremity? Come, come, be Hans still, play the shoemaker, Pull on my shoe. Enter the Lorp Mayor Hans. Mass, and that’s well rememb’red. Sybil. Here comes your father. Hans. Forware, metresse, ’tis un good skow, it sal vel dute, or ye sal neit betallen.’ Rose. Oh God, it pincheth me; what will you do? Hans. | Aside.| Your father’s presence pincheth, not the shoe. L. Mayor. Well done; fit my daughter well, and she shall please thee well. Hans. Yaw, yaw, ick weit dat well; forware, ’tis un good skoo, tis gimait van neits leither; se euer, mine here? Enter a Prentice L. Mayor. I do believe it—What’s the news with you? Prentice. Please you, the Earl of Lincoln at the gate Is newly lighted, and would speak with you. L. Mayor. The Earl of Lincoln come to speak with me? Well, well, I know his errand. Daughter Rose, 1Indeed, mistress, ’tis a good shoe, it shall fit well, or you shall not pay. 2 Yes, yes, I know that well; indeed, ’tis a good shoe, ’tis made of neat’s leather, | see here, good sir! =

THE SHOEMAKER’S HOLIDAY 515 Send hence your shoemaker, dispatch, have done! Syb, make things handsome! Sir boy, follow me. Exit. Hans. Mine uncle come! Oh, what may this portend? Sweet Rose, this of our love threatens an end. Rose. Be not dismay’d at this; whate’er befall, Rose is thine own. To witness I speak truth, Where thou appoint’st the place, I'll meet with thee. I will not fix a day to follow thee, But presently* steal hence. Do not reply: Love which gave strength to bear my father’s hate, Shall now add wings to further our escape. Exeunt. ScEeNnE V. [Another room in the same house] Enter the Lorp Mayor and the Earu or LINcoLNn L. Mayor. Believe me, on my credit, I speak truth: Since first your nephew Lacy went to France, I have not seen him. It seem’d strange to me, When Dodger told me that he stay’d behind, Neglecting the high charge the king imposed. Lincoln. Trust me, Sir Roger Oateley, I did think Your counsel had given head to this attempt, Drawn to it by the love he bears your child. Here I did hope to find him in your house; But now I see mine error, and confess, My judgment wrong’d you by conceiving so. L. Mayor. Lodge in my house, say you? Trust me, my lord, I love your nephew Lacy too too dearly, So much to wrong his honour; and he hath done so, That first gave him advice to stay from France. To witness I speak truth, I let you know, How careful I have been to keep my daughter Free from all conference or speech of him; Not that I scorn your nephew, but in love I bear your honour, lest your noble blood Should by my mean worth be dishonoured. 3 Immediately.

516 THOMAS DEKKER Lincoln. [ Aside.| How far the churl’s tongue wanders from his heart! Well, well, Sir Roger Oateley, I believe you, With more than many thanks for the kind love So much you seem to bear me. But, my lord, Let me request your help to seek my nephew, Whom if I find, I'll straight embark for France. So shall your Rose be free, my thoughts at rest, And much care die which now lies in my breast. Enter Sypiu Sybil. Oh Lord! Help, for God’s sake! My mistress; oh, my young mistress! L. Mayor. Where is thy mistress? What’s become of her? Sybil. She’s gone, she’s fled! L. Mayor. Gone! Whither is she fled? Sybil. I know not, forsooth; she’s fled out of doors with Hans the shoemaker; I saw them scud, scud, scud, apace, apace! L. Mayor. Which way? What, John! Where be my men? Which way? Sybil. I know not, an it please your worship. L. Mayor. Fled with a shoemaker? Can this be true? Sybil. Oh Lord, sir, as true as God’s in Heaven. Lincoln. Her love turn’d shoemaker? I am glad of this. L. Mayor. A Fleming butter-box, a shoemaker! Will she forget her birth, requite my care With such ingratitude? Scorn’d she young Hammon To love a honniken,' a needy knave? Well, let her fly, Pll not fly after her, Let her starve, if she will; she’s none of mine. Lincoln. Be not so cruel, sir. Enter Firx with shoes Sybil. I am glad, she’s scap’d. L. Mayor. V’ll not account of her as of my child. Was there no better object for her eyes 1 Simpleton (?).

How now, what knave is this? From whence comest thou? Firk. No knave, sir. I am Firk the shoemaker, lusty Roger’s chief lusty journeyman, and I have come hither to take up the pretty leg of sweet Mistress Rose, and thus hoping your worship is in as good health, as I was at the making hereof, I bid you farewell, yours, Firk. L. Mayor. Stay, stay, Sir Knave! Lincoln. Come hither, shoemaker! Firk. Tis happy the knave is put before the shoemaker, or else I would not have vouchsafed to come back to you. I am moved, for I stir. L. Mayor. My lord, this villain calls us knaves by craft. Firk. Then ’tis by the gentle craft, and to call one knave gently, is no harm. Sit your worship merry! Syb, your young mistress— I'll so bob’ them, now my Master Eyre is lord mayor of London. L. Mayor. Tell me, sirrah, whose man are you? Firk. I am glad to see your worship so merry. I have no maw to this gear, no stomach as yet to a red petticoat. Pointing to SyBi.. Lincoln. He means not, sir, to woo you to his maid, But only doth demand whose man you are. Firk. I sing now to the tune of Rogero. Roger, my fellow, is now my master. Lincoln. Sirrah, know’st thou one Hans, a shoemaker? Firk. Hans, shoemaker? Oh yes, stay, yes, I have him. I tell you what, I speak it in secret: Mistress Rose and he are by this time—no, not so, but shortly are to come over one another with “Can you dance the shaking of the sheets?” It is that Hans—[ Aside.] I'll so gull’ these diggers!® L.

518 THOMAS DEKKER L. Mayor. Tell me, good honest fellow, where he is, And thou shalt see what Pll bestow on thee. Firk. Honest fellow? No, sir; not so, sir; my profession is the gentle craft; I care not for seeing, I love feeling; let me feel it here; aurium tenus, ten pieces of gold; genuum tenus, ten pieces of silver; and then Firk is your man—[aside] in a new pair of stretchers.’ L. Mayor. Here is an angel, part of thy reward, Which I will give thee; tell me where he is. Firk. No point. Shall I betray my brother? No! Shall I prove Judas to Hans? No! Shall I cry treason to my corporation? No, I shall be firked and yerked then. But give me your angel; your angel shall tell you. Lincoln. Do so, good fellow; ’tis no hurt to thee. Firk. Send simpering Syb away. L. Mayor. Huswife, get you in. Exit Sysiu. Firk. Pitchers have ears, and maids have wide mouths; but for Hans Prauns, upon my word, to-morrow morning he and young Mistress Rose go to this gear, they shall be married together, by this rush, or else turn Firk to a firkin of butter, to tan leather withal. L. Mayor. But art thou sure of this? Firk. Am I] sure that Paul’s steeple is a handful higher than London Stone,’ or that the Pissing-Conduit’ leaks nothing but pure Mother Bunch?® Am I sure I am lusty Firk? God’s nails, do you think I am so base to gull you? Lincoln. Where are they married? Dost thou know the church? Firk. ] never go to church, but I know the name of it; it is a swearing church—stay a while, ’tis—ay, by the mass, no, no,—tis— ay, by my troth, no, nor that; *tis—ay, by my faith, that, that, ’tis, ay, by my Faith’s Church under Paul’s Cross. There they shall be knit like a pair of stockings in matrimony; there they'll be inconie.’ Lincoln. Upon my life, my nephew Lacy walks In the disguise of this Dutch shoemaker. Firk. Yes, forsooth.

Let me request your company, my lord; Your honourable presence may, no doubt, Refrain their headstrong rashness, when myself Going alone perchance may be o’erborne. Shall I request this favour? Lincoln. This, or what else. Firk. Then you must rise betimes, for they mean to fall to their hey-pass and repass,’® pindy-pandy, which hand will you have, very early. L. Mayor. My care shall every way equal their haste. This night accept your lodging in my house, The earlier shall we stir, and at Saint Faith’s Prevent this giddy hare-brain’d nuptial.

Be secret, on thy life. Exit. Firk. Yes, when I kiss your wife! Ha, ha, here’s no craft in the gentle craft.

Soft now; these two gulls will be at Saint Faith’s Church to-morrow morning, to take Master Bridegroom and Mistress Bride napping, and they, in the mean time, shall chop up the matter at the Savoy. But the best sport is, Sir Roger Oateley will find my fellow lame Ralph’s wife going to marry a gentleman, and then he'll stop her instead of his daughter. Oh brave! there will be fine tickling sport. Soft now, what have I to do? Oh, I know; now a mess of shoemakers meet at the Woolsack in Ivy Lane, to cozen” my gentleman of lame Ralph’s wife, that’s true. Alack, alack! Girls, hold out tack!

By mine honour, Rowland Lacy, none but the king shall wrong thee. Come, fear nothing, am not I Sim Eyre? Is not Sim Eyre lord mayor of London? Fear nothing, Rose: let them all say what they can; dainty, come thou to me—laughest thou? Marg. Good my lord, stand her friend in what thing you may. Eyre. Why, my sweet Lady Madgy, think you Simon Eyre can forget his fine Dutch journeyman? No, vah! Fie, I scorn it, it shall never be cast in my teeth, that I was unthankful. Lady Madgy, thou had’st never covered thy Saracen’s head with this French flap, nor loaden thy bum with this farthingale, (‘tis trash, trumpery, vanity) ; Simon Eyre had never walked in a red petticoat, nor wore a chain of gold, but for my fine journeyman’s Portuguese-—And shall I leave him? No! Prince am I none, yet bear a princely mind. Hans. My lord, ’tis time for us to part from hence. Eyre. Lady Madgy, Lady Madgy, take two or three of my piecrust-eaters, my buff-jerkin varlets, that do walk in black gowns at Simon Eyre’s heels; take them, good Lady Madgy; trip and go, my brown queen of periwigs, with my delicate Rose and my jolly Rowland to the Savoy; see them link’d, countenance the marriage; and when it is done, cling, cling together, you Hamborow turtle-doves.

By the Lord of Ludgate, it’s a mad life to be a lord mayor; it’s a stirring life, a fine life, a velvet life, a careful life. Well, Simon Eyre, yet set a good face on it, in the honour of Saint Hugh. Soft, the king this day comes to dine with me, to see my new buildings; his majesty is welcome, he shall have good cheer, delicate cheer, princely cheer. This day, my fellow prentices of London come to dine with me too, they shall have fine cheer, gentlemanlike cheer. I promised the mad Cappadocians, when we all served at the Conduit together, that if ever I came to be mayor of London, I would feast them all, and I’ll do’t, I'll do’t, by the life of Pharaoh; by this beard, Sim Eyre will be no flincher. Besides, I have procur’d that upon every Shrove-Tuesday, at the sound of the pancake bell, my fine dapper Assyrian lads shall clap up their shop windows, and away. This is the day, and this day they shall do’t, they shall do’t. Boys, that day are you free, let masters care, And prentices shall pray for Simon Eyre. Exit. ScenE II.

My masters, as we are the brave bloods of the shoemakers, heirs apparent to Saint Hugh, and perpetual benefactors to all good fellows, thou shalt have no wrong; were Hammon a king of spades, he should not delve in thy close without thy sufferance. But tell me, Ralph, art thou sure ’tis thy wife? Ralph. Am I sure this is Firk? This morning, when I stroked’ on her shoes, I looked upon her, and she upon me, and sighed, asked me if ever I knew one Ralph. Yes, said I. For his sake, said she— tears standing in her eyes—and for thou art somewhat like him, 1 Fitted. —

522 THOMAS DEKKER spend this piece of gold. I took it; my lame leg and my travel beyond sea made me unknown. All is one for that: I know she’s mine. Firk. Did she give thee this gold? O glorious glittering gold! She’s thine own, ’tis thy wife, and she loves thee; for I’ll stand to’t, there’s no woman will give gold to any man, but she thinks better of him than she thinks of them she gives silver to. And for Hammon, neither Hammon nor hangman shall wrong thee in London. Is not our old master Eyre, lord mayor? Speak, my hearts. All. Yes, and Hammon shall know it to his cost. Enter Hammon, Ais Serving-man, Jane and Others Hodge. Peace, my bullies; yonder they come. Ralph. Stand to’t, my hearts. Firk, let me speak first. Hodge. No, Ralph, let me-—Hammon, whither away so early? Ham. Unmannerly, rude slave, what’s that to thee? Firk. To him, sir? Yes, sir, and to me, and others. Good-morrow, Jane, how dost thou? Good Lord, how the world is changed with you! God be thanked! Ham. Villains, hands off! How dare you touch my love? All. Villains? Down with them! Cry clubs for prentices!? Hodge. Hold, my hearts! Touch her, Hammon? Yea, and more than that: we'll carry her away with us. My masters and gentlemen, never draw your bird-spits; shoemakers are steel to the back, men every inch of them, all spirit. Those of Hammon’s side. Well, and what of all this? Hodge. V'll show you—Jane, dost thou know this man? ’Tis Ralph, I can tell thee; nay, ’tis he in faith, though he be lam’d by the wars. Yet look not strange, but run to him, fold him about the neck and kiss him. Jane. Lives then my husband? Oh God, let me go, Let me embrace my Ralph. Ham. What means my Jane? Jane. Nay, what meant you, to tell me, he was slain? Ham. Pardon me, dear love, for being misled. {To Ratpu.] "T'was rumour’d here in London, thou wert dead. 2 “Clubs” was the rallying cry of the London apprentices.

THE SHOEMAKER’S HOLIDAY 523 Firk. Thou seest he lives. Lass, go, pack home with him. Now, Master Hammon, where’s your mistress, your wife? Serv. ’Swounds, master, fight for her! Will you thus lose her? All. Down with that creature! Clubs! Down with him! Hodge. Hold, hold! Ham. Hold, fool! Sirs, he shall do no wrong. Will my Jane leave me thus, and break her faith? Firk. Yea, sir! She must, sir! She shall, sir! What then? Mend it! Hodge. Hark, fellow Ralph, follow my counsel: set the wench in the midst, and let her choose her man, and let her be his woman. Jane. Whom should I choose? Whom should my thoughts affect But him whom Heaven hath made to be my love? Thou art my husband, and these humble weeds Make thee more beautiful than all his wealth. Therefore, I will but put off his attire, Returning it into the owner’s hand, And after ever be thy constant wife. Hodge. Not a rag, Jane! The law’s on our side; he that sows in another man’s ground, forfeits his harvest. Get thee home, Ralph; follow him, Jane; he shall not have so much as a busk-point® from thee. Firk. Stand to that, Ralph; the appurtenanées are thine own. Hammon, look not at her! Serv. O, swounds, no! Firk. Blue coat, be quiet, we'll give you a new livery else; we'll make Shrove Tuesday Saint George’s Day for you. Look not, Hammon, leer not! I'll firk you! For thy head now, one glance, one sheep’s eye, anything, at her! Touch not a rag, lest I and my brethren beat you to clouts. Serv. Come, Master Hammon, there’s no striving here. Ham. Good fellows, hear me speak; and, honest Ralph, Whom I have injured most by loving Jane, Mark what I offer thee: here in fair gold Is twenty pound, I’ll give it for thy Jane; If this content thee not, thou shalt have more. 3A lace with a tag, which fastened the busk, or piece of wood or whale-bone, used to keep the stays in position.

524 THOMAS DEKKER Hodge. Sell not thy wife, Ralph; make her not a whore. Ham. Say, wilt thou freely cease thy claim in her, And let her be my wife? All. No, do not, Ralph. Ralph. Sirrah, Hammon, Hammon, dost thou think a shoemaker is so base to be a bawd to his own wife for commodity? Take thy gold, choke with it! Were I not lame, I would make thee eat thy words. Firk. A shoemaker sell his flesh and blood? Oh indignity! Hodge. Sirrah, take up your pelf, and be packing. Ham. I will not touch one penny, but in lieu Of that great wrong I offered thy Jane, To Jane and thee I give that twenty pound. Since I have fail’d of her, during my life, I vow, no woman else shall be my wife. Farewell, good fellows of the gentle trade: Your morning mirth my mourning day hath made. Exit. Firk.

Villain, thou toldst me that my daughter Rose This morning should be married at Saint Faith’s; We have watch’d there these three hours at the least, Yet see we no such thing. Firk. Truly, I am sorry for’t; a bride’s a pretty thing. Hodge. Come to the purpose. Yonder’s the bride and bridegroom you look for, I hope. Though you be lords, you are not to bar by your authority men from women, are you?

THE SHOEMAKER’S HOLIDAY 525 L. Mayor. See, see, my daughter’s masked. Lincoln. True, and my nephew, To hide his guilt, counterfeits him lame. Firk. Yea, truly; God help the poor couple, they are lame and blind. L. Mayor. I'll ease her blindness. Lincoln. I'll his lameness cure. Firk. Lie down, sirs, and laugh! My fellow Ralph is taken for Rowland Lacy, and Jane for Mistress Damask Rose. This is all my knavery. L. Mayor. What, have I found you, minion? Lincoln. O base wretch Nay, hide thy face, the horror of thy guilt Can hardly be washed off. Where are thy powers? What battles have you made? O yes, I see, Thou fought’st with Shame, and Shame hath conquer’d thee. This lameness will not serve. L. Mayor. Unmask yourself. Lincoln. Lead home your daughter. L. Mayor. Take your nephew hence. Ralph. Hence! Swounds, what mean you? Are you mad? I hope you cannot enforce my wife from me. Where’s Hammon? L. Mayor. Your wife? Lincoln. What, Hammon? Ralph. Yea, my wife; and, therefore, the proudest of you that lays hands on her first, I'll lay my crutch ’cross his pate. Firk. To him, lame Ralph! Here’s brave sport! Ralph. Rose call you her?

Your nephew Lacy and your daughter Rose Early this morning wedded at the Savoy, None being present but the lady mayoress. Besides, I learnt among the officers, The lord mayor vows to stand in their defence ’Gainst any that shall seek to cross the match. Lincoln. Dares Eyre the shoemaker uphold the deed? Firk. Yes, sir, shoemakers dare stand in a woman’s quarrel, I warrant you, as deep as another, and deeper too. Dodger. Besides, his grace to-day dines with the mayor; Who on his knees humbly intends to fall And beg a pardon for your nephew’s fault. Lincoln. But V’ll prevent him! Come, Sir Roger Oateley; The king will do us justice in this cause. Howe’er their hands have made them man and wife, I will disjoin the match, or lose my life. Exeunt. Firk. Adieu, Monsieur Dodger! Farewell, fools! Ha, ha! Oh, if they had stay’d, I would have so lamb’d’ them with flouts! ... But let that pass, as my lady mayoress says. Hodge. This matter is answer’d.

Mark this old wench, my king: I danc’d the shaking of the sheets with her six and thirty years ago, and yet I hope to get two or three young lord mayors, ere I die. I am lusty still, Sim Eyre still. Care and cold lodging brings white hairs. My sweet Majesty, let care vanish, cast it upon thy nobles, it will make thee look always young like Apollo, and cry humph! Prince am I none, yet am I princely born. King. Ha, ha! Say, Cornwall, didst thou ever see his like? Cornwall. Not I, my lord. Enter the Earu oF LIncoitn and the Lorp Mayor King. Lincoln, what news with you? Lincoln. My gracious lord, have care unto yourself, For there are traitors here. All. Traitors? Where? Who? Eyre. Traitors in my house? God forbid! Where be my officers? I'll spend my soul, ere my king feel harm. King. Where is the traitor, Lincoln? Lincoln. Here he stands. King. Cornwall, lay hold on Lacy!—Lincoln, speak, What canst thou lay unto thy nephew’s charge? | Lincoln. This, my dear liege: your Grace, to do me honour, | Heap’d on the head of this degenerate boy Desertless favours; you made choice of him, To be commander over powers in France. But he— King. Good Lincoln, prithee, pause a while! Even in thine eyes I read what thou wouldst speak. I know how Lacy did neglect our love, Ran himself deeply, in the highest degree, Into vile treason—— Lincoln. Is he not a traitor? King. Lincoln, he was; now have we pard’ned him. ’Twas not a base want of true valour’s fire, That held him out of France, but love’s desire. Lincoln. I will not bear his shame upon my back.

THE SHOEMAKER’S HOLIDAY King. Nor shalt thou, Lincoln; I forgive you both. Lincoln. Then, good my liege, forbid the boy to wed One whose mean birth will much disgrace his bed. King. Are they not married? Lincoln. No, my liege. Both. We are. King. Shall I divorce them then? O be it far, That any hand on earth should dare untie The sacred knot, knit by God’s majesty; I would not for my crown disjoin their hands That are conjoin’d in holy nuptial bands. How say’st thou, Lacy, wouldst thou lose thy Rose? Lacy. Not for all India’s wealth, my sovereign. King. But Rose, I am sure, her Lacy would forego? Rose. If Rose were asked that question, she’d say no. King. You hear them, Lincoln? Lincoln. Yea, my liege, I do. King. Yet canst thou find i’th’ heart to part these two? Who seeks, besides you, to divorce these lovers? L. Mayor. I do, my gracious lord, I am her father. King. Sir Roger Oateley, our last mayor, I think? Nobleman. The same, my liege. 533 King. Would you offend Love’s laws? Well, you shall have your wills, you sue to me, To prohibit the match. Soft, let me see— You both are married, Lacy, art thou not? Lacy. I am, dread sovereign. King. Then, upon thy life, I charge thee, not to call this woman wife. L. Mayor. I thank your grace. Rose. O my most gracious lord! Kneels. King. Nay, Rose, never woo me; I tell you true, Although as yet I am a bachelor, Yet I believe, I shall not marry you. Rose. Can you divide the body from the soul, Yet make the body live?

534 THOMAS DEKKER King. Yea, so profound? I cannot, Rose, but you I must divide. This fair maid, bridegroom, cannot be your bride. Are you pleas’d, Lincoln? Oateley, are you pleas’d? Both. Yes, my lord. King. Then must my heart be eas’d; For, credit me, my conscience lives in pain, Till these whom I divore’d, be join’d again. Lacy, give me thy hand; Rose, lend me thine! Be what you would be! Kiss now! So, that’s fine. At night, lovers, to bed!—Now, let me see, ~ Which of you all mislikes this harmony. L. Mayor. Will you then take from me my child perforce? King. Why, tell me, Oateley: shines not Lacy’s name As bright in the world’s eye as the gay beams Of any citizen? Lincoln. Yea, but, my gracious lord, I do mislike the match far more than he; Her blood is too too base. King. Lincoln, no more. Dost thou not know that love respects no blood, Cares not for difference of birth or state? The maid is young, well born, fair, virtuous, A worthy bride for any gentleman. Besides, your nephew for her sake did stoop To bare necessity, and, as I hear, Forgetting honours and all courtly pleasures, To gain her love, became a shoemaker. As for the honour which he lost in France, Thus I redeem it: Lacy, kneel thee down!— Arise, Sir Rowland Lacy! Tell me now, Tell me in earnest, Oateley, canst thou chide, Seeing thy Rose a lady and a bride? L. Mayor. 1 am content with what your grace hath done. Lincoln. And I, my liege, since there’s no remedy. King. Come on, then, all shake hands: I'll have you friends; Where there is much love, all discord ends. 3

THE SHOEMAKER’S HOLIDAY 535 What says my mad lord mayor to all this love? Eyre. O my liege, this honour you have done to my fine journeyman here, Rowland Lacy, and all these favours which you have shown to me this day in my poor house, will make Simon Eyre live longer by one dozen of warm summers more than he should. King. Nay, my mad lord mayor, that shall be thy name; If any grace of mine can length thy life, One honour more I'll do thee: that new building,” Which at thy cost in Cornhill is erected, Shall take a name from us; we'll have it call’d The Leadenhall, because in digging it You found the lead that covereth the same. Eyre. I thank your majesty. Marg. God bless your grace! King. Lincoln, a word with you! Enter Honce, Firx, Ratpu, and more Shoemakers Eyre. How now, my mad knaves? Peace, speak softly, yonder is the king. King. With the old troop which there we keep in pay, We will incorporate a new supply. Before one summer more pass o’er my head, France shall repent, England was injured. What are all those? Lacy. All shoemakers, my liege, Sometime my fellows; in their companies I liv’d as merry as an emperor. King. My mad lord mayor, are all these shoemakers? Eyre. All shoemakers, my liege; all gentlemen of the gentle craft, true Trojans, courageous cordwainers; they all kneel to the shrine of holy Saint Hugh. All the Shoemakers. God save your majesty! King. Mad Simon, would they anything with us? Eyre. Mum, mad knaves! Not a word! I'll do’t; I warrant you. 2“a, D. 1419. This year Sir Symon Eyre built Leadenhall, at his proper expense, as it now appears, and gave the same to the City to be employed as a public granary for laying up corn against a time of scarcity.”—Maitland, History and Survey of London, ii., p. 187, quoted by Rhys.

536 THOMAS DEKKER They are all beggars, my liege; all for themselves, and I for them all on both my knees do entreat, that for the honour of poor Simon Eyre and the good of his brethren, these mad knaves, your grace would vouchsafe some privilege to my new Leadenhall, that it may be lawful for us to buy and sell leather there two days a week. King. Mad Sim, I grant your suit, you shall have patent To hold two market-days in Leadenhall, Mondays and Fridays, those shall be the times. Will this content you? All. Jesus bless your grace! Eyre. In the name of these my poor brethren shoemakers, I most humbly thank your grace. But before I rise, seeing you are in the giving vein and we in the begging, grant Sim Eyre one boon more. King. What is it, my lord mayor? Eyre. Vouchsafe to taste of a poor banquet that stands sweetly waiting for your sweet presence. King. I shall undo thee, Eyre, only with feasts; Already have I been too troublesome; Say, have I not? Eyre. O my dear king, Sim Eyre was taken unawares upon a day of shroving,’ which I promised long ago to the prentices of London. For, an’t please your highness, in time past, I bare the water-tankard,* and my coat Sits not a whit the worse upon my back; And then, upon a morning, some mad boys, It was Shrove Tuesday, even as ’tis now, gave me my breakfast, and I swore then by the stopple of my tankard, if ever I came to be lord mayor of London, I would feast all the prentices. This day, my liege, I did it, and the slaves had an hundred tables five times covered; they are gone home and vanished; Yet add more honour to the gentle trade, Taste of Eyre’s banquet, Simon’s happy made. 3 Merry-making. 4 As an apprentice.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE BEn Jonson was born of poor parents at Westminster in 1573. Through the influence of Camden, the antiquary, he got a good education at Westminster School; but he does not seem to have gone to a University, though later both Oxford and Cambridge gave him degrees. In his youth he practised for a time his stepfather’s trade of bricklaying, and he served as a soldier in Flanders. It was probably about 1595 that he began to write for the stage, and within a few years he was recognized as a distinguished playwright. His comedy of “Every Man in His Humour” was not only a great immediate success, but founded a school of satirical drama in England. “Sejanus” and “Catiline” were less popular, but are impressive pictures of Roman life, less interesting but more accurate than the Roman plays of Shakespeare. For the court of James I, Jonson wrote a large number of masques, which procured him substantial rewards in the form of pensions. But it was between 1605 and 1614 that Jonson’s greatest work was done. “Volpone,” “Epicceene,” “The Alchemist,” and “Bartholomew Fair” belong to this period, and are all masterpieces. After the accession of Charles I, Jonson fell into adversity. His plays were less successful and he had enemies at court; but he continued to hold his position of leadership among his fellow authors. A specimen of Jonson’s prose will be found in the volume of “English Essays” in the Harvard Classics, and a number of his graceful lyrics in the first volume of “English Poetry.” Jonson died in 1637, and was celebrated in a volume of elegies to which all the chief poets of the day contributed. “The Alchemist” is perhaps the most perfect technically of Jonson’s plays, and is an admirable satire on the quacks and humbugs of the day. It contains, at the same time, so much universal human nature, and is so excellent in art, that it holds a place among the first of those Eliza- — bethan works that have held the interest of posterity.

PROLOGUE Fortune, that favours fools, these two short hours We wish away, both for your sakes and ours, Judging spectators; and desire, in place, To th’ author justice, to ourselves but grace. Our scene is London, ’cause we would make known, No country’s mirth is better than our own: No clime breeds better matter for your whore, Bawd, squire, impostor, many persons more, Whose manners, now call’d humours, feed the stage; And which have still been subject for the rage Or spleen of comic writers. Though this pen Did never aim to grieve, but better men; Howe’er the age he lives in doth endure The vices that she breeds, above their cure. But when the wholesome remedies are sweet, And in their working gain and profit meet, He hopes to find no spirit so much diseas’d, But will with such fair correctives be pleas’d: For here he doth not fear who can apply. If there be any that will sit so nigh Unto the stream, to look what it doth run, They shall find things, they’d think or wish were done: They are so natural follies, but so shown, As even the doers may see, and yet not own.

The process then was right. Face. Yes, by the token, sir, the retort brake, And what was sav’d was put into the pellican, And sign’d with Hermes’ seal. Sub. I think ’twas so. We should have a new amalgama. Sur. [ Aside.] O, this ferret | Is rank as any polecat. Sub. But I care not; Let him e’en die; we have enough beside, In embrion. H has his white shirt on? Face. Yes, sir, He’s ripe for inceration, he stands warm, In his ash-fire. I would not you should let Any die now, if I might counsel, sir, For luck’s sake to the rest: it is not good. Mam. He says right. Sur. [ Aside.] Ah, are you bolted? Face. Nay, I know’t, sir, 11 A net for catching rabbits. 12 Dissolving fluids.

THE ALCHEMIST 575 I have seen the ill fortune. What is some three ounces Of fresh materials? Mam. Is’t no more? Face. No more, sir, Of gold, t? amalgam with some six of mercury. Mam. Away, here’s money. What will serve? Face. Ask him, sir. Mam. How much? Sub. Give him nine pound: you may gi’ him ten. Sur. Yes, twenty, and be cozen’d, do. Mam. There ’tis. [Gives Face the money.] Sub. This needs not; but that you will have it so, To see conclusions of all: for two Of our inferior works are at fixation, A third is in ascension. Go your ways. Ha’ you set the oil of luna in kemia? Face. Yes, sir. Sub. And the philosopher’s vinegar? Face. Ay. [Ezit.] Sur. We shall have a salad! Mam. When do you make projection? Sub. Son, be not hasty, I exalt our med’cine, By hanging him in balneo vaporoso, And giving him solution; then congeal him; And then dissolve him; then again congeal him; For look, how oft I iterate the work, So many times I add unto his virtue. As if at first one ounce convert a hundred, After his second loose, he’ll turn a thousand; His third solution, ten; his fourth, a hundred; After his fifth, a thousand thousand ounces Of any imperfect metal, into pure Silver or gold, in all examinations, As good as any of the natural mine. Get you your stuff here against afternoon, Your brass, your pewter, and your andirons. Mam. Not those of iron?

576 BEN JONSON Sub, Yes, you may bring them too; We'll change all metals. Sur. I believe you in that. Mam. Then I may send my spits? Sub. Yes, and your racks. Sur. And dripping-pans, and pot-hangers, and hooks? Shall he not? Sub. If he please. Sur. —To be an ass. Sub. How, sir! Mam. This gent’man you must bear withal: I told you he had no faith. Sur. And little hope, sir; But much less charity, should I gull myself. Sub. Why, what have you observ’d, sir, in our art, Seems so impossible? Sur. But your whole work, no more. That you should hatch gold in a furnace, sir, As they do eggs in Egypt! Sub. Sir, do you Believe that eggs are hatch’d so? Sur. If I should? Sub. Why, I think that the greater miracle. No egg but differs from a chicken more Than metals in themselves. Sur. That cannot be. The egg’s ordain’d by nature to that end, And is a chicken in potentia. Sub. The same we say of lead and other metals, Which would be gold if they had time. Mam. And that Our art doth further. Sub. Ay, for ’twere absurd To think that nature in the earth bred gold Perfect i’ the instant: something went before. There must be remote matter. Sur. Ay, what is that?

THE ALCHEMIST 577 Sub. Marry, we say— Mam. Ay, now it heats: stand, father, Pound him to dust. Sub. It is, of the one part, A humid exhalation, which we call Materia liquida, or the unctuous water; On th’ other part, a certain crass and viscous Portion of earth; both which, concorporate, Do make the elementary matter of gold; Which is not yet propria materia, But common to all metals and all stones; For, where it is forsaken of that moisture, And hath more dryness, it becomes a stone: Where it retains more of the humid fatness, It turns to sulphur, or to quicksilver, Who are the parents of all other metals. Nor can this remote matter suddenly Progress so from extreme unto extreme, As to grow gold, and leap o’er all the means. Nature doth first beget th’ imperfect, then Proceeds she to the perfect. Of that airy And oily water, mercury is engend’red; Sulphur o’ the fat and earthy part; the one, Which is the last, supplying the place of male, The other, of the female, in all metals. Some do believe hermaphrodeity, That both do act and suffer. But these two Make the rest ductile, malleable, extensive. And even in gold they are; for we do find Seeds of them by our fire, and gold in them; And can produce the species of each metal More perfect thence, than nature doth in earth. Beside, who doth not see in daily practice Art can beget bees, hornets, beetles, wasps, Out of the carcases and dung of creatures; Yea, scorpions of an herb, being rightly plac’d? And these are living creatures, far more perfect

578 BEN JONSON And excellent than metals. Mam. Well said, father! Nay, if he take you in hand, sir, with an argument, He'll bray you in a mortar. Sur. Pray you, sir, stay. Rather than I'll be bray’d, sir, I'll believe That Alchemy is a pretty kind of game, Somewhat like tricks o’ the cards, to cheat a man With charming. Sub. Sir? Sur. What else are all your terms, Whereon no one o’ your writers ’grees with other? Of your elixir, your lac virginis, Your stone, your med’cine, and your chrysosperm, Your sal, your sulphur, and your mercury, Your oil of height, your tree of life, your blood, Your marchesite, your tutie, your magnesia, Your toad, your crow, your dragon, and your panther; Your sun, your moon, your firmament, your adrop, Your lato, azoch, zernich, chibrit, heautarit, And then your red man, and your white woman, With all your broths, your menstrues, and materials Of piss and egg-shells, women’s terms, man’s blood, Hair o’ the head, burnt clouts, chalk, merds, and clay, Powder of bones, scalings of iron, glass, And worlds of other strange ingredients, Would burst a man to name? Sub. And all these nam’d, Intending but one thing; which art our writers Us’d to obscure their art. Mam. Sir, so I told him— Because” the simple idiot should not learn it, And make it vulgar. Sub. Was not all the knowledge Of the A.gyptians writ in mystic symbols? Speak not the scriptures oft in parables? 13Tn order that.

THE ALCHEMIST 579 Are not the choicest fables of the poets, That were the fountains and first springs of wisdom, Wrapt in perplexed allegories? Mam. I urg’d that, And clear’d to him, that Sisyphus was damn’d To roll the ceaseless stone, only because He would have made ours common. Dot appears {at the door.|— Who is this?

This must not hear. Mam. No, he will not be gull’d; let him alone. Face. You're very right, sir; she is a most rare scholar, And is gone mad with studying Broughton’s* works. If you but name a word touching the Hebrew, She falls into her fit, and will discourse So learnedly of genealogies, As you would run mad too, to hear her, sir. Mam. How might one do t’ have conference with her, Lungs? Face. O, divers have run mad upon the conference: I do not know, sir. I am sent in haste To fetch a vial. Sur. Be not gull’d, Sir Mammon. Mam.

So pleasant! She'll mount you up, like quicksilver, Over the helm; and circulate like oil, A very vegetal: discourse of state, Of mathematics, bawdry, anything—— Mam.

Which his cannot: the sanctified cause Should have a sanctified course. Trt. Not always necessary: The children of perdition are oft times Made instruments even of the greatest works.

As, put the case, That some great man in state, he have the gout, Why, you but send three drops of your elixir, You help him straight: there you have made a friend. Another has the palsy or the dropsy, He takes of your incombustible stuff, He’s young again: there you have made a friend. A lady that is past the feat of body, Though not of mind, and hath her face decay’d Beyond all cure of paintings, you restore, With the oil of talc: there you have made a friend; And all her friends. A lord that is a leper, A knight that has the bone-ache, or a squire

You may be anything, and leave off to make Long-winded exercises; or suck up Your ha! and hum! ina tune. I not deny, But such as are not graced in a state, May, for their ends, be adverse in religion, And get a tune to call the flock together: For, to say sooth, a tune does much with women And other phlegmatic people; it is your bell. Ana. Bells are profane; a tune may be religious. Sub. No warning with you? Then farewell my patience. Slight, it shall down; I will not be thus tortur’d. Tri. I pray you, sir. Sub. All shall perish.

Nor shall you need o’er night to eat huge meals, To celebrate your next day’s fast the better; The whilst the brethren and the sisters humbled, Abate the stiffness of the flesh. Nor cast Before your hungry hearers scrupulous bones;° As whether a Christian may hawk or hunt, Or whether matrons of the holy assembly May lay their hair out, or wear doublets, Or have that idol, starch, about their linen. Ana. It is indeed an idol. Tri. Mind him not, sir. I do command thee, spirit (of zeal, but trouble), To peace within him! Pray you, sir, go on. Sub. Nor shall you need to libel ’gainst the prelates, And shorten so your ears’ against the hearing Of the next wire-drawn grace. Nor of necessity Rail against plays, to please the alderman Whose daily custard you devour; nor lie With zealous rage till you are hoarse. Not one Of these so singular arts. Nor call yourselves By names of Tribulation, Persecution, Restraint, Long-patience, and such like, affected By the whole family or wood’ of you, Only for glory, and to catch the ear Of the disciple.

When you have view’d and bought ’em, And ta’en the inventory of what they are, They are ready for projection; there’s no more To do: cast on the med’cine, so much silver As there is tin there, so much gold as brass, Pll gi’ it you in by weight.

We must now increase Our fire to ignis ardens;” we are past Fimus equinus, balnei, cineris,* And all those lenter’* heats. If the holy purse Should with this draught fall low, and that the saints Do need a present sum, I have a trick To melt the pewter, you shall buy now instantly, And with a tincture make you as good Dutch dollars As any are in Holland. Tri. Can you so? Sub. Ay, and shall bide the third examination. Ana. It will be joyful tidings to the brethren. Sub. But you must carry it secret. Trt. Ay; but stay, This act of coining, is it lawful? Ana. Lawful! We know no magistrate: or, if we did, This is foreign coin. Sub. It is no coining, sir. It is but casting. Tri. Ha! you distinguish well: Casting of money may be lawful. Ana. Tis, sir. Tri. Truly, I take it so.

I see You're lodg’d here, in the house of a rare man, An excellent artist; but what’s that to you? Dol. Yes, sir; I study here the mathematics, And distillation.

THE ALCHEMIST Mam. O, I cry your pardon. He’s a divine instructor! can extract The souls of all things by his art; call all The virtues, and the miracles of the sun, Into a temperate furnace; teach dull nature What her own forces are. A man, the emp’ror Has courted above Kelly;* sent his medals And chains, t’ invite him. Dol. Ay, and for his physic, sir-—— Mam. Above the art of Aésculapius, That drew the envy of the thunderer! I know all this, and more. Dol. Troth, I am taken, sir, Whole with these studies, that contemplate nature. Mam. It is a noble humour; but this form Was not intended to so dark a use. Had you been crooked, foul, of some coarse mould, A cloister had done well; but such a feature That might stand up the glory of a kingdom, To live recluse! is a mere solcecism, Though in a nunnery. It must not be. I muse, my lord your brother will permit it: You should spend half my land first, were I he. Does not this diamond better on my finger Than i’ the quarry? Dol. Yes. Mam. Why, you are like it. You were created, lady, for the light. Here, you shall wear it; take it, the first pledge Of what I speak, to bind you to believe me. Dol. In chains of adamant? Mam. Yes, the strongest bands. And take a secret too.—Here, by your side, Doth stand this hour the happiest man in Europe. Dol. You are contented, sir? Mam. Nay, in true being, 3 The partner of Dee, the astrologer. 615

616 BEN JONSON The envy of princes and the fear of states. Dol. Say you so, Sir Epicure? Mam. Yes, and thou shalt prove it, Daughter of honour. I have cast mine eye Upon thy form, and I will rear this beauty Above all styles. Dol. You mean no treason, sir? Mam. No, I will take away that jealousy. I am the lord of the philosopher’s stone, And thou the lady. Dol. How, sir! ha’ you that? Mam. | am the master of the mastery.* This day the good old wretch here o’ the house Has made it for us: now he’s at projection. Think therefore thy first wish now, let me hear it; And it shall rain into thy lap, no shower, But floods of gold, whole cataracts, a deluge, To get a nation on thee. Dol. You are pleas’d, sir, To work on the ambition of our sex. Mam. I’m pleas’d the glory of her sex should know, This nook here of the Friars is no climate For her to live obscurely in, to learn Physic and surgery, for the constable’s wife Of some odd hundred in Essex; but come forth, And taste the air of palaces; eat, drink The toils of empirics, and their boasted practice; Tincture of pearl, and coral, gold, and amber; Be seen at feasts and triumphs; have it ask’d, What miracle she is; set all the eyes Of court a-fire, like a burning glass, And work them into cinders, when the jewels Of twenty states adorn thee, and the light Strikes out the stars! that, when thy name is mention’d, Queens may look pale; and we but showing our love, Nero’s Poppza may be lost in story! 4The art of transmutation.

THE ALCHEMIST 617 Thus will we have it. Dol. I could well consent, sir. But in a monarchy, how will this be? The prince will soon take notice, and both seize You and your stone, it being a wealth unfit For any private subject. Mam. If he knew it. Dol. Yourself do boast it, sir. Mam. To thee, my life. Dol. O, but beware, sir! You may come to end The remnant of your days in a loath’d prison, By speaking of it. Mam. Tis no idle fear. We'll therefore go with all, my girl, and live In a free state, where we will eat our mullets, Sous’d in high-country wines, sup pheasants’ eggs, And have our cockles boil’d in silver shells; Our shrimps to swim again, as when they liv’d, In a rare butter made of dolphins’ milk, Whose cream does look like opals; and with these Delicate meats set ourselves high for pleasure, And take us down again, and then renew Our youth and strength with drinking the elixir, And so enjoy a perpetuity Of life and lust! And thou shalt ha’ thy wardrobe Richer than nature’s, still to change thyself, And vary oftener, for thy pride, than she, Or art, her wise and almost-equal servant. [Re-enter Face] Face. Sir, you are too loud. I hear you every word Into the laboratory. Some fitter place; The garden, or great chamber above. How like you her? Mam. Excellent! Lungs. There’s for thee. [ Gives him money.]| Face. But do you hear? Good sir, beware, no mention of the rabbins.

THE ALCHEMIST Welcome; I know thy lusts, and thy desires, And I will serve and satisfy em. Begin, Charge me from thence, or thence, or in this line; Here is my centre: ground thy quarrel. Kas. You lie. Sub. How, child of wrath and anger! the loud lie? For what, my sudden boy? Kas. Nay, that look you to, I am aforehand. Sub. O, this is no true grammar, And as ill logic! You must render causes, child, Your first and second intentions, know your canons And your divisions, moods, degrees, and differences, Your predicaments, substance, and accident, Series extern and intern, with their causes, Efficient, material, formal, final, And ha’ your elements perfect? Kas. What is this? The angry’ tongue he talks in? Sub. That false precept, Of being aforehand, has deceiv’d a number, And made ’em enter quarrels oftentimes Before they were aware; and afterward, Against their wills. Kas. How must I do then, sir? Sub. I cry this lady mercy; she should first Have been saluted. Kisses her. I do call you lady, Because you are to be one ere ’t be long, My soft and buxom widow. Kas. Is she, i’ faith? Sub. Yes, or my art is an egregious liar. Kas. How know you? Sub. By inspection on her forehead, And subtlety of her lip, which must be tasted Often to make a judgment. Kisses her again. ’Slight, she melts Like a myrobolane.’ Here is yet a line, 2Swaggering. 3A kind of dried plum, esteemed as a sweetmeat.

[ Re-enter Faces, in his uniform | Kas. Hold your peace. Here comes the t’ other rare man.— Save you, captain. Face. Good Master Kastril! Is this your sister? Kas. Ay, sir.

The count is come. Sub. Where is he? Face. At the door. Sub. Why, you must entertain him. Face. What will you do With these the while? Sub.

I am a gentleman come here disguis’d, Only to find the knaveries of this citadel; And where I might have wrong’d your honour, and have not, I claim some interest in your love. You are, They say, a widow, rich; and I’m a bachelor, — Worth nought: your fortunes may make me a man, As mine ha’ preserv’d you a woman. Think upon it, And whether I have deserv’d you or no. Dame P. I will, sir. Sur. And for these household-rogues, let me alone To treat with them. [Enter Sust.e] Sub. How doth my noble Diego, And my dear madam countess? Hath the count Been courteous, lady? liberal and open? Donzel,’ methinks you look melancholic, I do not like the dulness of your eye; It hath a heavy cast, ’tis upsee Dutch,’ And says you are lumpish.

636 BEN JONSON Sur. No, sir, There’s no such thing intended. A good cart® And a clean whip shall ease you of that fear. I am the Spanish don that should be cozened, Do you see? Cozened? Where’s your Captain Face, That parcel*-broker, and whole-bawd, all rascal ? [Enter Face in his uniform | Face. How, Surly! Sur. O, make your approach, good captain. I have found from whence your copper rings and spoons Come now, wherewith you cheat abroad in taverns. "Twas here you learn’d t’anoint your boot with brimstone, Then rub men’s gold on’t for a kind of touch, And say ’twas naught, when you had changed the colour, That you might ha’t for nothing. And this doctor, Your sooty, smoky-bearded compeer, he Will close you so much gold, in a bolt’s-head, And, on a turn, convey i’ the stead another With sublim’d mercury, that shall burst in the heat, And fly out all in fumo! Then weeps Mammon; Then swoons his worship. [Face slips out.| Or, he is the Faustus, That casteth figures’ and can conjure, cures Plagues, piles, and pox, by the ephemerides,’ And holds intelligence with all the bawds And midwives of three shires: while you send in—— Captain!—what! is he gone?—damsels with child, Wives that are barren, or the waiting-maid With the green sickness.

He isa slave, Whate’er he is, and the son of a whore——Are you The man, sir, I would know? Sur. I should be loth, sir, To confess so much. : Kas. Then you lie i’ your throat. Sur. How! Face. [To Kasrrit.] A very arrant rogue, sir, and a cheater, Employ’d here by another conjurer That does not love the doctor, and would cross him If he knew how. Sur. Sir, you are abus’d. Kas. You lie: And ’tis no matter. Face. Well said, sir! He is The impudent’st rascal—— Sur. You are indeed. Will you hear me, sir? Face. By no means: bid him be gone. Kas. Begone, sir, quickly. Sur. This is strange!—Lady, do you inform your brother. Face. There is not such a foist’ in all the town. The doctor had him presently; and finds yet The Spanish count will come here.—Bear up, Subtle. | Aside. Sub. Yes, sir, he must appear within this hour. Face. And yet this rogue would come in a disguise, By the temptation of another spirit, To trouble our art, though he could not hurt it! Kas.

Nay, sir, you must quarrel him out o’ the house. Kas. I will: —Sir, if you get not out o’ doors, you lie; And you are a pimp. Sur. Why, this is madness, sir, Not valour in you; I must laugh at this. Kas. It is my humour; you are a pimp and a trig. And an Amadis de Gaul, or a Don Quixote. Drug. Or a knight o’ the curious coxcomb, do you see? [Enter ANantas | Ana. Peace to the household! Kas.

Thou art not of the light! That ruff of pride About thy neck, betrays thee; and is the same With that which the unclean birds, in seventy-seven,” Were seen to prank it with on divers coasts: Thou look’st like antichrist, in that lewd hat.

Sir, I know. _ The Spaniard hates the brethren, and hath spies Upon their actions: and that this was one I make no scruple.——But the holy synod Have been in prayer and meditation for it; And ’tis reveal’d no less to them than me, That casting of money is most lawful. Sub. True. But here I cannot do it: if the house Should chance to be suspected, all would out, And we be lock’d up in the Tower for ever, To make gold there for th’ state, never come out; And then are you defeated. Ana. I will tell This to the elders and the weaker brethren, That the whole company of the separation May join in humble prayer again. Sub. And fasting. Ana. Yea, for some fitter place. The peace of mind Rest with these walls! [ Exit. ] Sub. Thanks, courteous Ananias. Face. What did he come for? Sub. About casting dollars, Presently out of hand. And so I told him, A Spanish minister came here to spy, Against the faithful 8In Kyd’s Spanish Tragedy.

THE ALCHEMIST 641 Face. I conceive. Come, Subtle, Thou art so down upon the least disaster! How wouldst thou ha’ done, if I had not help’d thee out? Sub. I thank thee, Face, for the angry boy, i’ faith. Face. Who would ha’ look’d? it should ha’ been that rascal Surly? He had dy’d his beard and all. Well, sir. Here’s damask come to make you a suit.

By your favour, Face, Now she is honest, I will stand again. Face. You will not offer it? Sub. Why? Face. Stand to your word, Or—here comes Dol. She knows—— Sub. You're tyrannous still.

PHILASTER OR LOVE LIES A-BLEEDING BY FRANCIS BEAUMONT AND JOHN FLETCHER

INTRODUCTORY NOTE Tue men who laid the foundations of the Elizabethan drama were generally of obscure origin; and though some of them had been educated at the universities, they were all poor. Beaumont and Fletcher are the first recruits to the profession of play-writing who came of distinguished families and habitually moved in wealthy circles; and this social environment was early suggested as an explanation of their power of representing naturally the conversation of high-born ladies and gentlemen. Francis Beaumont, son of Sir Francis Beaumont, was born about 1585, and died in 1616. He was educated at Oxford and studied law at the Inner Temple; and though his career as a writer was short he won a high reputation as a poet and was buried in Westminster Abbey. John Fletcher, son of the Bishop of London, was born in 1579, and died in 1625. He was a graduate of Cambridge, and appears to have been much more a professional man of letters than Beaumont. He wrote many plays by himself, and, after Beaumont ceased to write, worked in collaboration with several other men, including Shakespeare. “Philaster” is an excellent typical example of their plays, which are thus admirably characterized by Thorndike: “Their plots, largely invented, are ingenious and complicated. They deal with royal or noble persons, with heroic actions, and are placed in foreign localities. The conquests, usurpations, and passions that ruin kingdoms are their themes, there are no battles or pageants, and the action is usually confined to the rooms of the palace or its immediate neighborhood. Usually contrasting a story of gross sensual passion with one of idyllic love, they introduce a great variety of incidents, and aim at constant but varied excitement. ... The plays depend for interest not on their observation or revelation of human nature, or the development of character, but on the variety of situations, the clever construction that holds the interest through one suspense to another up to the unravelling at the very end, and on the naturalness, felicity, and vigor of the poetry.”

[ The presence chamber in the palace] Enter Dion, CLEREMONT, and 'THRASILINE Cleremont RE’S nor lords nor ladies. Dion. Credit me, gentlemen, I wonder at it. They receiv’d strict charge from the King to attend here; besides, it was boldly published that no officer should forbid any gentleman that desired to attend and hear. Cle. Can you guess the cause? Dion. Sir, it is plain, about the Spanish Prince, that’s come to marry our kingdom’s heir and be our sovereign. Thra. Many that will seem to know much say she looks not on him like a maid in love. Dion. Faith, sir, the multitude, that seldom know any thing but their own opinions, speak that they would have; but the prince, before his own approach, receiv’d so many confident messages from the state, that I think she’s resolv’d to be rul’d. Cle. Sir, it is thought, with her he shall enjoy both these kingdoms of Sicily and Calabria. 667

668 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER Dion. Sir, it is without controversy so meant. But ’twill be a troublesome labour for him to enjoy both these kingdoms with safety, the right heir to one of them living, and living so virtuously; especially, the people admiring the bravery of his mind and lamenting his injuries. Cle. Who, Philaster? Dion. Yes; whose father, we all know, was by our late King of Calabria unrighteously deposed from his fruitful Sicily. Myself drew some blood in those wars, which I would give my hand to be washed from. Cle. Sir, my ignorance in state-policy will not let me know why, Philaster being heir to one of these kingdoms, the King should suffer him to walk abroad with such free liberty. Dion. Sir, it seems your nature is more constant than to inquire after state-news. But the King, of late, made a hazard of both the kingdoms, of Sicily and his own, with offering but to imprison Philaster; at which the city was in arms, not to be charmed down by any state-order or proclamation, till they saw Philaster ride through the streets pleased and without a guard; at which they threw their hats and their arms from them; some to make bonfires, some to drink, all for his deliverance: which wise men say is the cause the King labours to bring in the power of a foreign nation to awe his own with. Enter Gatatea, a Lady and Mecra Thra. See, the ladies! What’s the first? Dion. A wise and modest gentlewoman that attends the princess. Cle. The second? Dion. She is one that may stand still discreetly enough, and illfavour’dly dance her measure; simper when she is courted by her friend, and slight her husband. Cle. The last? Dion. Faith, I think she is one whom the state keeps for the agents of our confederate princes; she'll cog’ and lie with a whole army, before the league shall break. Her name is common through the kingdom, and the trophies of her dishonour advanced beyond 1 Cheat.

PHILASTER 669 Hercules’ Pillars. She loves to try the several constitutions of men’s bodies; and, indeed, has destroyed the worth of her own body by making experiment upon it for the good of the commonwealth. Cle. She’s a profitable member. Meg. Peace, if you love me! You shall see these gentlemen stand their ground and not court us. Gal. What if they should? La. What if they should! Meg. Nay, let her alone-—What if they should! Why, if they should, I say they were never abroad. What foreigner would do so? It writes them directly untravell’d. Gal. Why, what if they be? La. What if they be! Meg. Good madam, let her go on—What if they be! Why, if they be, I will justify, they cannot maintain discourse with a judicious lady, nor make a leg’ nor say “Excuse me.” Gal. Ha, ha, ha! Meg. Do you laugh, madam? Dion. Your desires upon you, ladies! Meg. Then you must sit beside us. Dion. I shall sit near you then, lady. Meg. Near me, perhaps; but there’s a lady endures no stranger; and to me you appear a very strange fellow. La. Methinks he’s not so strange; he would quickly be acquainted. Thra. Peace, the King! / Enter Kinc, PHAaRAMOND, ARETHUSA, and Train King. To give a stronger testimony of love Than sickly promises (which commonly In princes find both birth and burial In one breath) we have drawn you, worthy sir, To make your fair endearments to our daughter, And worthy services known to our subjects, Now lov’d and wondered at; next, our intent To plant you deeply our immediate heir Both to our blood and kingdoms. For this lady, 2 Bow.

670 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER (The best part of your life, as you confirm me, And I believe,) though her few years and sex Yet teach her nothing but her fears and blushes, Desires without desire, discourse and knowledge Only of what herself is to herself, Make her feel moderate health; and when she sleeps, In making no ill day, knows no ill dreams. Think not, dear sir, these undivided parts, That must mould up a virgin, are put on To show her so, as borrowed ornaments To speak her perfect love to you, or add An artificial shadow to her nature,— No, sir; I boldly dare proclaim her yet No woman. But woo her still, and think her modesty A sweeter mistress than the offer’d language Of any dame, were she a queen, whose eye Speaks common loves and comforts to her servants. Last, noble son (for so I now must call you), What I have done thus public, is not only To add a comfort in particular To you or me, but all; and to confirm The nobles and the gentry of these kingdoms By oath to your succession, which shall be Within this month at most. Thra. This will be hardly done. Cle. It must be ill done, if it be done. Dion. When ’tis at best, ’twill be but half done, whilst So brave a gentleman is wrong’d and flung off. Thra. | fear. Cle. Who does not? Dion. I fear not for myself, and yet I fear too. Well, we shall see, we shall see. No more. Pha. Kissing your white hand, mistress, I take leave To thank your royal father; and thus far To be my own free trumpet. Understand, Great King, and these your subjects, mine that must be, 3 Lovers.

PHILASTER 671 (For so deserving you have spoke me, sir. And so deserving I dare speak myself,) To what a person, of what eminence, Ripe expectation, of what faculties, Manners and virtues, you would wed your kingdoms; You in me have your wishes. Oh, this country! By more than all the gods, I hold it happy; Happy in their dear memories that have been Kings great and good; happy in yours that is; And from you (as a chronicle to keep Your noble name from eating age) do I Opine myself most happy. Gentlemen, Believe me in a word, a prince’s word, There shall be nothing to make up a kingdom Mighty and flourishing, defenced, fear’d, Equal to be commanded and obeyed, But through the travails of my life Pll find it, And tie it to this country. By all the gods, My reign shall be so easy to the subject, That every man shall be his prince himself, And his own law—yet I his prince and law. And, dearest lady, to your dearest self (Dear in the choice of him whose name and lustre Must make you more and mightier) let me say, You are the blessed’st living; for, sweet princess, You shall enjoy a man of men to be Your servant; you shall make him yours, for whom Great queens must die. ThAra. Miraculous! Cle. This speech calls him Spaniard, being nothing but a large: inventory of his own commendations. Dion. 1 wonder what’s his price; for certainly He'll sell himself, he has so prais’d his shape. Enter Puaster But here comes one more worthy those large speeches, Than the large speaker of them.

672 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER Let me be swallowed quick, if I can find, In all the anatomy of yon man’s virtues, One sinew sound enough to promise for him, He shall be constable. By this sun, He'll ne’er make king unless it be for trifles, In my poor judgment. Phi. | kneeling.| Right noble sir, as low as my obedience, And with a heart as loyal as my knee, I beg your favour. King. Rise; you have it, sir. [PHmaster rises. ] Dion. Mark but the King, how pale he looks! He fears! Oh, this same whorson conscience, how it jades us! King. Speak your intents, sir. Phi. Shall I speak ’em freely? Be still my royal sovereign. King. As a subject, We give you freedom. Dion. Now it heats. Phi. Then thus I turn My language to you, prince; you, foreign man! Ne’er stare nor put on wonder, for you must Endure me, and you shall. This earth you tread upon (A dowry, as you hope, with this fair princess), By my dead father (oh, I had a father, Whose memory I bow to!) was not left To your inheritance, and I up and living— Having myself about me and my sword, The souls of all my name and memories, These arms and some few friends beside the gods— To part so calmly with it, and sit still And say, “I might have been.” I tell thee, Pharamond, When thou art king, look I be dead and rotten, And my name ashes: for, hear me, Pharamond! This very ground thou goest on, this fat earth, My father’s friends made fertile with their faiths, Before that day of shame shall gape and swallow Thee and thy nation, like a hungry grave, ff

PHILASTER 673 Into her hidden bowels. Prince, it shall; By the just gods, it shall! Pha. He’s mad; beyond cure, mad. Dion. Here is a fellow has some fire in’s veins: The outlandish prince looks like a tooth-drawer. Phi. Sir prince of popinjays,* I’ll make it well Appear to you I am not mad. King. You displease us: You are too bold. Phi. No, sir, Iam too tame, Too much a turtle, a thing born without passion, A faint shadow, that every drunken cloud Sails over, and makes nothing. King. I do not fancy this. Call our physicians; sure, he’s somewhat tainted. Thra. 1 do not think ’twill prove so. Dion. H’as given him a general purge already, For all the right he has; and now he means To let him blood. Be constant, gentlemen: By heaven, I'll run his hazard, Although I run my name out of the kingdom! Cle. Peace, we are all one soul. Pha. What you have seen in me to stir offence I cannot find, unless it be this lady, Offer’d into mine arms with the succession; Which I must keep, (though it hath pleas’d your fury To mutiny within you,) without disputing Your genealogies, or taking knowledge Whose branch you are. The King will leave it me, And I dare make it mine. You have your answer. Phi. If thou wert sole inheritor to him That made the world his,’ and couldst see no sun Shine upon any thing but thine; were Pharamond As truly valiant as I feel him cold, And ring’d among the choicest of his friends 4Parrots. 5 Unbalanced in mind. 67, ¢., Alexander the Great.

King. Sir, you wrong the prince; I gave you not this freedom To brave our best friends. You deserve our frown. Go to; be better temper’d. Phi. It must be, sir, when I am nobler us’d. Gal. Ladies, This would have been a pattern of succession, Had he ne’er met this mischief. By my life, He is the worthiest the true name of man This day within my knowledge. Meg. I cannot tell what you may call your knowledge; But the other is the man set in mine eye. Oh, ’tis a prince of wax!* Gal. A dog it is.’ King. Philaster, tell me The injuries you aim at in your riddles. Phi. If you had my eyes, sir, and sufferance, My griefs upon you, and my broken fortunes, My wants great, and now nought but hopes and fears, My wrongs would make ill riddles to be laugh’d at. Dare you be still my king, and right me not? King. Give me your wrongs in private. Phi. Take them, And ease me of a load would bow strong Atlas, They whisper. Cle. He dares not stand the shock. Dion. I cannot blame him; there’s danger in’t. Every man in this age has not a soul of crystal, for all men to read their actions through: men’s hearts and faces are so far asunder, that they hold no intelligence. Do but view yon stranger well, and you shall see a fever through all his bravery, and feel him shake like a true tenant.” If he give not back his crown again upon the report of an elder-gun, I have no augury. 7Bugbears. 8A model prince. % The phrase, a dog of wax, is used elsewhere in a contemptuous sense, but has not been explained. 1° Probably corrupt.

Yes, with my father’s spirit. It’s here, O King, A dangerous spirit! Now he tells me, King, I was a king’s heir, bids me be a king, And whispers to me, these are all my subjects. ’Tis strange he will not let me sleep, but dives Into my fancy, and there gives me shapes That kneel and do me service, cry me king: But [ll suppress him; he’s a factious spirit, And will undo me—[To Puar.] Noble sir, your hand; I am your servant.

If you be called Philaster, ’tis to you. Phi. Kiss her fair hand, and say I will attend her. [Exit Lady.] Dion. Do you know what you do? Phi. Yes; go to see a woman. Cle. But do you weigh the danger you are in? Phi. Danger in a sweet face! By Jupiter, I must not fear a woman! Thra. But are you sure it was the princess sent? It may be some foul train’ to catch your life. Phi. I do not think it, gentlemen; she’s noble. Her eye may shoot me dead, or those true red And white friends in her cheeks may steal my soul out; There’s all the danger in’t. But, be what may, Her single name hath armed me. Exit. Dion. Go on, And be as truly happy as thou’rt fearless!— Come, gentlemen, let’s make our friends acquainted, Lest the King prove false. Exeunt. [Scene II.

678 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER Are. Will Philaster come? Lady. Dear madam, you were wont to credit me At first. Are. But didst thou tell me so? I am forgetful, and my woman’s strength Is so o’ercharg’d with dangers like to grow About my marriage, that these under-things Dare not abide in such a troubled sea. How look’d he when he told thee he would come? Lady. Why, well. Are. And not a little fearful? Lady. Fear, madam! Sure, he knows not what it is. Are. You all are of his faction; the whole court Is bold in praise of him; whilst I May live neglected, and do noble things, As fools in strife throw gold into the sea, Drown’d in the doing. But, I know he fears. Lady. Fear, madam! Methought, his looks hid more Of love than fear. Are. Of love! To whom? To you? Did you deliver those plain words I sent, With such a winning gesture and quick look That you have caught him? Lady. Madam, I mean to you. Are. Of love to me! alas, thy ignorance Lets thee not see the crosses of our births! Nature, that loves not to be questioned Why she did this or that, but has her ends, And knows she does well, never gave the world Two things so opposite, so contrary, As he and I am: if a bowl of blood Drawn from this arm of mine would poison thee, A draught of his would cure thee. Of love to me! Lady. Madam, I think I hear him. | Are. Bring him in. [Exit Lady.] You gods, that would not have your dooms withstood, Whose holy wisdoms at this time it is

PHILASTER To make the passion of a feeble maid The way unto your justice, I obey. [Re-enter [Lady with] PHtasTer Lady. Here is my Lord Philaster. Are. Oh, ’tis well. Withdraw yourself. Phi. | Madam, your messenger Made me believe you wish’d to speak with me. Are. Tis true, Philaster; but the words are such I have to say, and do so ill beseem The mouth of woman, that I wish them said, And yet am loath to speak them. Have you known That I have aught detracted from your worth? Have I in person wrong’d you, or have set My baser instruments to throw disgrace Upon your virtues? Phi. Never, madam, you. Are. Why, then, should you, in such a public place, Injure a princess, and a scandal lay Upon my fortunes, fam’d to be so great, Calling a great part of my dowry in question? Phi. Madam, this truth which I shall speak will be Foolish: but, for your fair and virtuous self, I could afford myself to have no right To any thing you wish’d. Are. Philaster, know, I must enjoy these kingdoms. Phi. Madam, both? Are. Both, or I die: by heaven, I die, Philaster, If I not calmly may enjoy them both. Phi. I would do much to save that noble life; Yet would be loath to have posterity _ Find in our stories, that Philaster gave His right unto a sceptre and a crown To save a lady’s longing. Are. Nay, then, hear: 679 [Exit Lady.]

680 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER I must and will have them, and more—— Phi. What more? Are. Or lose that little life the gods prepared To trouble this poor piece of earth withal. Phi. Madam, what more? Are. Turn, then, away thy face. Phi. No. Are. Do. Phi. I can endure it. Turn away my face! I never yet saw enemy that look’d So dreadfully, but that I thought myself As great a basilisk’ as he; or spake So horrible, but that I thought my tongue Bore thunder underneath, as much as his; Nor beast that I could turn from. Shall I then Begin to fear sweet sounds? A lady’s voice, Whom I do love? Say you would have my life; Why, I will give it you; for ’tis of me A thing so loath’d, and unto you that ask Of so poor use, that I shall make no price: If you entreat, I will unmov'dly hear. Are. Yet, for my sake, a little bend thy looks. Phi. I do. Are. Then know, I must have them and thee. Phi. And me? Are. Thy love; without which, all the land Discovered yet will serve me for no use But to be buried in. Phi. Is’t possible? Are. With it, it were too little to bestow On thee. Now, though thy breath do strike me dead, (Which, know, it may,) I have unript my breast. Phi. Madam, you are too full of noble thoughts, To lay a train for this contemned life, Which you may have for asking. To suspect Were base, where I deserve no ill. Love you! 1 A fabulous serpent that killed with a glance.

— PHILASTER By all my hopes, I do, above my life! But how this passion should proceed from you So violently, would amaze a man That would be jealous.’ Are. Another soul into my body shot Could not have fill’d me with more strength and spirit Than this thy breath. But spend not hasty time In seeking how I came thus: ’tis the gods, The gods, that make me so; and, sure, our love Will be the nobler and the better blest, In that the secret justice of the gods Is mingled with it. Let us leave, and kiss; Lest some unwelcome guest should fall betwixt us, And we should part without it. Phi. *T will be ill I should abide here long. Are. "Tis true; and worse You should come often. How shall we devise To hold intelligence, that our true loves, On any new occasion, may agree What path is best to tread? Phi. I have a boy, Sent by the gods, I hope, to this intent, Not yet seen in the court. Hunting the buck, I found him sitting by a fountain’s side, Of which he borrow’d some to quench his thirst, And paid the nymph again as much in tears. A garland lay him by, made by himself, Of many several flowers bred in the vale, Stuck in that mystic order that the rareness Delighted me: but ever when he turn’d His tender eyes upon ’em, he would weep, As if he meant to make ’em grow again. Seeing such pretty helpless innocence Dwell in his face, I ask’d him all his story. He told me that his parents gentle died, 2 Suspicious. 681

682 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER Leaving him to the mercy of the fields, Which gave him roots; and of the crystal springs, Which did not stop their courses; and the sun, Which still, he thank’d him, yielded him his light. Then took he up his garland, and did show What every flower, as country-people hold, Did signify, and how all, ordered thus, Express’d his grief; and, to my thoughts, did read The prettiest lecture of his country-art That could be wish’d: so that methought I could Have studied it. I gladly entertain’d Him, who was glad to follow; and have got The trustiest, loving’st, and the gentlest boy That ever master kept. Him will I send To wait on you, and bear our hidden love. Are. *Tis well; no more. Re-enter Lady Lady. Madam, the prince is come to do his service. Are. What will you do, Philaster, with yourself? Pht. Why, that which all the gods have pointed out for me. Are. Dear, hide thyself. — Bring in the prince. [ Exit Lady. ] Phi. Hide me from Pharamond! When thunder speaks, which is the voice of God, Though I do reverence, yet I hide me not; And shall a stranger-prince have leave to brag Unto a foreign nation, that he made Philaster hide himself? Are. He cannot know it. Phi. Though it should sleep for ever to the world, It is a simple sin to hide myself, Which will for ever on my conscience lie. Are. Then, good Philaster, give him scope and way In what he says; for he is apt to speak What you are loath to hear. For my sake, do. Phi. I will.

PHILASTER 683 [Re]-enter [Lady with| PHaramMonp Pha. My princely mistress, as true lovers ought, I come to kiss these fair hands, and to show, [Exit Lady.] In outward ceremonies, the dear love Writ in my heart. Phi. If I shall have an answer no directlier, I am gone. Pha. To what would he have answer? Are. To his claim unto the kingdom. Pha. Sirrah, I forbare you before the King— Phi. Good sir, do so still; I would not talk with you. Pha. But now the time is fitter. Do but offer To make mention of right to any kingdom, Though it be scarce habitable—— Phi. Good sir, let me go. Pha. And by the gods— Phi. Peace, Pharamond! if thou-— Are. Leave us, Philaster. Phi. I have done. | Going. | Pha. You are gone! by Heaven I'll fetch you back. Phi. You shall not need. | Returning. | Pha. What now? Phi. Know, Pharamond, I loathe to brawl with such a blast as thou, Who art nought but a valiant voice; but if Thou shalt provoke me further, men shall say, “Thou wert,” and not lament it. Pha. Do you slight My greatness so, and in the chamber of The princess? Phi. It is a place to which I must confess I owe a reverence; but were’t the church, Ay, at the altar, there’s no place so safe, Where thou dar’st injure me, but I dare kill thee. And for your greatness, know, sir, I can grasp You and your greatness thus, thus into nothing.

684 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER Give not a word, not a word back! Farewell. Exit. Pha. *Tis an odd fellow, madam; we must stop His mouth with some office when we are married. Are. You were best make him your controller. Pha. I think he would discharge it well. But, madam, I hope our hearts are knit; but yet so slow The ceremonies of state are, that ‘twill be long Before our hands be so. If then you please, Being agreed in heart, let us not wait For dreaming form, but take a little stolen Delights, and so prevent’ our joys to come. Are. If you dare speak such thoughts, I must withdraw in honour. Exit. Pha. The constitution of my body will never hold out till the wedding; I must seek elsewhere. Exit. ACT THE SECOND ScEnE I.

Sir, you did take me up When I was nothing; and only yet am something By being yours. You trusted me unknown; And that which you were apt to conster" A simple innocence in me, perhaps Might have been craft, the cunning of a boy Hard’ned in lies and theft: yet ventur’d you To part my miseries and me; for which, I never can expect to serve a lady 3 Anticipate. 1 Construe, interpret.

PHILASTER 685 That bears more honour in her breast than you. Phi. But, boy, it will prefer’ thee. Thou art young, And bear’st a childish overflowing love To them that clap thy cheeks and speak thee fair yet; But when thy judgment comes to rule those passions, Thou wilt remember best those careful friends That plac’d thee in the noblest way of life. She is a princess I prefer thee to. Bel. In that small time that I have seen the world, I never knew a man hasty to part With a servant he thought trusty. I remember, My father would prefer the boys he kept To greater men than he; but did it not Till they were grown too saucy for himself. Phi. Why, gentle boy, I find no fault at all In thy behaviour. Bel. Sir, if I have made A fault in ignorance, instruct my youth: I shall be willing, if not apt, to learn; Age and experience will adorn my mind With larger knowledge; and if I have done A wilful fault, think me not past all hope For once. What master holds so strict a hand Over his boy, that he will part with him Without one warning? Let me be corrected To break my stubbornness, if it be so, Rather than turn me off; and I shall mend. Phi. Thy love doth plead so prettily to stay, That, trust me, I could weep to part with thee. Alas, I do not turn thee off! Thou knowest It is my business that doth call thee hence; And when thou art with her, thou dwell’st with me. Think so, and ’tis so; and when time is full, That thou hast well discharg’d this heavy trust, Laid on so weak a one, I will again 2 Advance.

But since I am to part with you, my lord, And none knows whether I shall live to do More service for you, take this little prayer: Heaven bless your loves, your fights, all your designs! May sick men, if they have your wish, be well; And Heaven hate those you curse, though I be one! Exit. Phi. The love of boys unto their lords is strange; I have read wonders of it: yet this boy For my sake (if a man may judge by looks And speech) would out-do story. I may see A day to pay him for his loyalty. Exit. [Scene II. A gallery in the palace] Enter PHARAMOND Pha. Why should these ladies stay so long? They must come this way. I know the queen employs ’em not; for the reverend mother’ sent me word, they would all be for the garden. If they should all prove honest’ now, I were in a fair taking; I was never so long without sport in my life, and, in my conscience, ’tis not my fault. Oh, for our country ladies! Enter GALaTEA Here’s one bolted; I’ll hound at her—Madam! Gal. Your grace! Pha. Shall I not be a trouble? Gal. Not to me, sir. Pha. Nay, nay, you are too quick. By this sweet hand—— Gal. You'll be forsworn, sir; ’tis but an old glove. If you will talk at distance, I am for you: But, good prince, be not bawdy, nor do not brag; These two I bar; 1In charge of the maids of honor. 2 Chaste.

PHILASTER 687 And then, I think, I shall have sense enough To answer all the weighty apophthegms Your royal blood shall manage. Pha. Dear lady, can you love? Gal. Dear prince! how dear? I ne’er cost you a coach yet, nor put you to the dear repentance of a banquet. Here’s no scarlet, sir, to blush the sin out it was given for. This wire mine own hair covers; and this face has been so far from being dear to any, that it ne’er cost penny painting; and, for the rest of my poor wardrobe, such as you see, it leaves no hand’ behind it, to make the jealous mercer’s wife curse our good doings. Pha. You mistake me, lady. Gal. Lord, I do so; would you or I could help it! Pha. You're very dangerous bitter, like a potion. Gal. No, sir, I do not mean to purge you, though I mean to purge a little time on you. Pha. Do ladies of this country use to give No more respect to men of my full being? Gal. Full being! I understand you not, unless your grace means growing to fatness; and then your only remedy (upon my knowledge, prince) is, in a morning, a cup of neat white wine brew’d with carduus,* then fast till supper; about eight you may eat; use exercise, and keep a sparrow-hawk; you can shoot in a tiller:° but, of all, your grace must fly phlebotomy,’ fresh pork, conger,'’ and clarified whey; they are all duller of the vital spirits. Pha. Lady, you talk of nothing all this while. Gal. ’Tis very true, sir; I talk of you. Pha. | Aside.| This is a crafty wench; I like her wit well; ’twill be rare to stir up a leaden appetite. She’s a Danaé, and must be courted in a shower of gold.—Madam, look here; all these, and more than—— Gal. What have you there, my lord? Gold! now, as I live, ’tis fair gold!

If there be but two such more in this kingdom, and near the court, we may even hang up our harps. Ten such camphire® constitutions as this would call the golden age again in question, and teach the old way for every ill-fac’d husband to get his own children; and what a mischief that would breed, let all consider!

Pha. | Aside.| She gives good words yet; sure this wench is free— If your more serious business do not call you, Let me hold quarter with you; we will talk An hour out quickly. Meg. What would your grace talk of? Pha. Of some such pretty subject as yourself: I'll go no further than your eye, or lip; There’s theme enough for one man for an age. Meg. Sir, they stand right, and my lips are yet even, Smooth, young enough, ripe enough, and red enough, Or my glass wrongs me. Pha. Oh, they are two twinn’d cherries dy’d in blushes Which those fair suns above with their bright beams Reflect upon and ripen. Sweetest beauty, Bow down those branches, that the longing taste Of the faint looker-on may meet those blessings, And taste and live. They kiss. Meg. | Aside.| Oh, delicate sweet prince!

PHILASTER 689 You have in such neat poetry gathered a kiss, That if I had but five lines of that number, Such pretty begging blanks,” I should commend Your forehead or your cheeks, and kiss you too. Pha. Do it in prose; you cannot miss it, madam. Meg. I shall, I shall. Pha. By my life, but you shall not; I'll prompt you first. [Kisses her.] Can you do it now? Meg. Methinks ’tis easy, now you ha’ done’t before me; But yet I should stick at it. [ Kisses him.] Pha. Stick till to-morrow; I'll ne’er part you, sweetest. But we lose time: Can you love me? Meg. Love you, my lord! How would you have me love you? Pha. Vl teach you in a short sentence, ’cause I will not load your memory; this is all: love me, and lie with me. Meg. Was it “lie with you” that you said? Tis impossible. Pha. Not to a willing mind, that will endeavour. If I do not teach you to do it as easily in one night as you'll go to bed, I'll lose my royal blood for’t. Meg. Why, prince, you have a lady of your own That yet wants teaching. Pha. Vl sooner teach a mare the old measures” than teach her anything belonging to the function. She’s afraid to lie with herself if she have but any masculine imaginations about her. I know, when we are married, I must ravish her. Meg. By mine honour, that’s a foul fault, indeed; But time and your good help will wear it out, sir. Has your grace seen the court-star, Galatea? Pha. Out upon her! She’s as cold of her favour as an apoplex; she sailed by but now. Meg. And how do you hold her wit, sir? Pha. \ hold her wit? The strength of all the guard cannot hold it, if they were tied to it; she would blow ’em out of the kingdom.

I dare not, prince, I dare not. Pha. Make your own conditions, my purse shall seal em; and what you dare imagine you can want, I'll furnish you withal. Give two hours to your thoughts every morning about it. Come, I know you are bashful; Speak in my ear, will you be mine? Keep this, And with it me: soon I will visit you. Meg. My lord, my chamber’s most unsafe; but when ’tis night, I'll find some means to slip into your lodging; Till when—— Pha. Till when, this and my heart go with thee! Exeunt several ways.

Get him another wench, and you bring him to bed indeed. Dion, ’Tis strange a man cannot ride a stage Or two, to breathe himself, without a warrant. If his gear hold, that lodgings be search’d thus, Pray God we may lie with our own wives in safety, That they be not by some trick of state mistaken! Enter [Attendants] with Mecra | below | King. Now, lady of honour, where’s your honour now? No man can fit your palate but the prince. Thou most ill-shrouded rottenness, thou piece Made by a painter and a ’pothecary, Thou troubled sea of lust, thou wilderness Inhabited by wild thoughts, thou swoln cloud Of infection, thou ripe mine of all diseases, Thou all-sin, all-hell, and last all-devils, tell me, Had you none to pull on with your courtesies But he that must be mine, and wrong my daughter? By all the gods, all these, and all the pages, And all the court, shall hoot thee through the court, Fling rotten oranges, make ribald rhymes, And sear thy name with candles upon walls! Do you laugh, Lady Venus? Meg. Faith, sir, you must pardon me; I cannot choose but laugh to see you merry. If you do this, O King! nay, if you dare do it, By all those gods you swore by, and as many More of my own, I will have fellows, and such

698 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER Fellows in it, as shall make noble mirth! The princess, your dear daughter, shall stand by me On walls, and sung in ballads, any thing. Urge me no more; I know her and her haunts, Her lays, leaps, and outlays, and will discover all; Nay, will dishonour her. I know the boy She keeps; a handsome boy, about eighteen; Know what she does with him, where, and when. Come, sir, you put me to a woman’s madness, The glory of a fury; and if I do not Do’t to the height—— King. What boy is this she raves at? Meg. Alas! good-minded prince, you know not these things! I am loath to reveal ’em. Keep this fault, As you would keep your health from the hot air Of the corrupted people, or, by Heaven, I will not fall alone. What I have known Shall be as public as a print; all tongues Shall speak it as they do the language they Are born in, as free and commonly; Ill set it, Like a prodigious’ star, for all to gaze at, And so high and glowing, that other kingdoms far and foreign Shall read it there, nay, travel with it, till they find No tongue to make it more, nor no more people; And then behold the fall of your fair princess! King. Has she a boy? Cle. So please your grace, I have seen a boy wait On her, a fair boy. King. Go, get you to your quarter: For this time I will study to forget you. Meg. Do you study to forget me, and I'll study To forget you. Exeunt Kine, Mecra, and Guard. Cle. Why, here’s a male spirit fit for Hercules. If ever there be _ Nine Worthies of women, this wench shall ride astride and be their | captain. Dion. Sure, she has a garrison of devils in her tongue, she uttered 6 Portentous, ominous.

PHILASTER 699 such balls of wild-fire. She has so nettled the King, that all the doctors in the country will scarce cure him. That boy was a strangefound-out antidote to cure her infection; that boy, that princess’ boy; that brave, chaste, virtuous lady’s boy; and a fair boy, a well-spoken boy! All these considered, can make nothing else—but there I leave you, gentlemen. Thra. Nay, we'll go wander with you. ACT THE THIRD Scene I. [The court of the palace| Enter Dion, CLEREMONT, and THRASILINE Cle. Nay, doubtless, ’tis true. Dion. Ay; and ’tis the gods That rais’d this punishment, to scourge the King With his own issue. Is it not a shame For us that should write noble in the land, For us that should be freemen, to behold A man that is the bravery of his age, Philaster, press’d down from his royal right By this regardless King? and only look And see the sceptre ready to be cast Into the hands of that lascivious lady That lives in lust with a smooth boy, now to be married To yon strange prince, who, but that people please To let him be a prince, is born a slave In that which should be his most noble part, His mind? Thra. That man that would not stir with you To aid Philaster, let the gods forget That such a creature walks upon the earth! Cle. Philaster is too backward in ’t himself. The gentry do await it, and the people, Against their nature, are all bent for him, And like a field of standing corn, that’s moved With a stiff gale, their heads bow all one way. Exeunt.

700 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER Dion. The only cause that draws Philaster back From this attempt is the fair princess’ love, Which he admires, and we can now confute. ThAra. Perhaps he'll not believe it. Dion. Why, gentlemen, ’tis without question so. Cle. Ay, ’tis past speech, she lives dishonestly. But how shall we, if he be curious,’ work Upon his faith? Thra. We all are satisfied within ourselves. Dion. Since it is true, and tends to his own good, I'll make this new report to be my knowledge; I'll say I know it; nay, I'll swear I saw it. Cle. It will be best. Thra. ’*T will move him. Enter PHILASTER Dion. Here he comes. Good morrow to your honour: we have spent Some time in seeking you. Phi. My worthy friends, You that can keep your memories to know Your friend in miseries, and cannot frown On men disgrac’d for virtue, a good day Attend you all! What service may I do Worthy your acceptation? Dion. My good lord, We come to urge that virtue, which we know Lives in your breast, forth. Rise, and make a head: The nobles and the people are all dulled With this usurping king; and not a man, That ever heard the word, or knew such a thing As virtue, but will second your attempts. Phi. How honourable is this love in you To me that have deserv’d none! Know, my friends, (You, that were born to shame your poor Philaster With too much courtesy,) I could afford 1Scrupulous. Raise an armed force.

PHILASTER 7OI To melt myself in thanks: but my designs Are not yet ripe. Suffice it, that ere long I shall employ your loves; but yet the time Is short of what I would. Dion. The time is fuller, sir, than you expect; That which hereafter will not, perhaps, be reach’d By violence, may now be caught. As for the King, You know the people have long hated him; But now the princess, whom they lov’d—— Phi. Why, what of her? Dion. Is loathed as much as he. Phi. By what strange means? Dion. She’s known a whore. Phi. Thou liest. Dion. My lord—— Phi. Thou liest, Offers to draw and 1s held. And thou shalt feel it! I had thought thy mind Had been of honour. Thus to rob a lady Of her good name, is an infectious sin Not to be pardon’d. Be it false as hell, ’Twill never be redeem’d, if it be sown Amongst the people, fruitful to increase All evil they shall hear. Let me alone That I may cut off falsehood whilst it springs! Set hills on hills betwixt me and the man That utters this, and I will scale them all, And from the utmost top fall on his neck, Like thunder from a cloud. Dion. This is most strange: Sure, he does love her. Phi. I do love fair truth. She is my mistress, and who injures her Draws vengeance from me. Sirs, let go my arms. Thra. Nay, good my lord, be patient. Cle. Sir, remember this is your honour’d friend, That comes to do his service, and will show you Why he utter’d this.

702 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER Phi. I ask you pardon, sir; My zeal to truth made me unmannerly: Should I have heard dishonour spoke of you, Behind your back, untruly, I had been As much distemper’d and enrag’d as now. Dion. But this, my lord, is truth. Phi. Oh, say not so! Good sir, forbear to say so; ’tis then truth, That womankind is false: urge it no more; It is impossible. Why should you think The princess light? Dion. Why, she was taken at it. Phi. ’Tis false! by Heaven, ’tis false! It cannot be! Can it? Speak, gentlemen; for God’s love, speak! Is’t possible? Can women all be damn’d? Dion. Why, no, my lord. Phi. Why, then, it cannot be. Dion. And she was taken with her boy. Phi. What boy? Dion. A page, a boy that serves her. Phi. Oh, good gods! A little boy? Dion. Ay; know you him, my lord? Phi. | Aside.| Hell and sin know him!—Sir, you are deceiv’d; I'll reason it a little coldly with you. If she were lustful, would she take a boy, That knows not yet desire? She would have one Should meet her thoughts and know the sin he acts, Which is the great delight of wickedness. You are abus’d,’ and so is she, and I. Dion. How you, my lord? Phi. Why, all the world’s abused In an unjust report. Dion. Oh, noble sir, your virtues | Cannot look into the subtle thoughts of woman! In short, my lord, I took them; I myself. 3 Deceived.

PHILASTER Phi. Now, all the devils, thou didst! Fly from my rage! Would thou hadst ta’en devils engend’ring plagues, When thou didst take them! Hide thee from mine eyes! Would thou hadst taken thunder on thy breast, When thou didst take them; or been strucken dumb For ever; that this foul deed might have slept In silence! Thra. Have you known him so ill-tempered? Cle. Never before. Phi. The winds, that are let loose From the four several corners of the earth, And spread themselves all over sea and land, Kiss not a chaste one. What friend bears a sword To run me thorough? Dion. Why, my lord, are you So moved at this? Phi. When any fall from virtue, I am distract; I have an interest in ’t. Dion. But, good my lord, recall yourself, and think What’s best to be done. Phi. I thank you; I will do it. Please you to leave me; I'll consider of it. To-morrow I will find your lodging forth, And give you answer. Dion. All the gods direct you The readiest way! Thra. He was extreme impatient. Cle. It was his virtue and his noble mind. 793 [Exeunt Dion, CLEREMONT, and TurasILINE. | Phi. 1 had forgot to ask him where he took them; I'll follow him. Oh, that I had a sea Within my breast, to quench the fire I feel! More circumstances will but fan this fire: It more afflicts me now, to know by whom This deed is done, than simply that ’tis done; And he that tells me this is honourable, As far from lies as she is far from truth.

704 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER Oh, that, like beasts, we could not grieve ourselves With that we see not! Bulls and rams will fight To keep their females, standing in their sight; But take em from them, and you take at once Their spleens away; and they will fall again Unto their pastures, growing fresh and fat; And taste the waters of the springs as sweet As ’twas before, finding no start in sleep; But miserable man—— Enter BELLARIO See, see, you gods, He walks still; and the face you let him wear When he was innocent is still the same, Not blasted! Is this justice? Do you mean To intrap mortality, that you allow Treason so smooth a brow? I cannot now Think he is guilty. Bel. Health to you, my lord! The princess doth commend her love, her life, And this, unto you. Gives a letter. Phi. Oh, Bellario, Now I perceive she loves me; she does show it In loving thee, my boy; she has made thee brave. . Bel. My lord, she has attir’d me past my wish, Past my desert; more fit for her attendant, Though far unfit for me who do attend. Phi. Thou art grown courtly, boy.—Oh, let all women, That love black deeds, learn to dissemble here, Here, by this paper! She does write to me As if her heart were mines of adamant To all the world besides; but, unto me, A maiden-snow that melted with my looks.— Tell me, my boy, how doth the princess use thee? For I shall guess her love to me by that. Bel. Scarce like her servant, but as if I were Something allied to her, or had preserv’d

PHILASTER Her life three times by my fidelity; As mothers fond do use their only sons, As I'd use one that’s left unto my trust, For whom my life should pay if he met harm, So she does use me. Phi. Why, this is wondrous well: But what kind language does she feed thee with? Bel. Why, she does tell me she will trust my youth With all her loving secrets, and does call me Her pretty servant; bids me weep no more For leaving you; she’ll see my services Regarded: and such words of that soft strain, That I am nearer weeping when she ends Than ere she spake. Phi. This is much better still. Bel. Are you not ill, my lord? Phi. Ill? No, Bellario. Bel. Methinks your words Fall not from off your tongue so evenly, Nor is there in your looks that quietness That I was wont to see. Phi. Thou art deceiv’d, boy: And she strokes thy head? Bel. Yes. Phi. And she does clap thy cheeks? Bel. She does, my lord. Phi. And she does kiss thee, boy? ha! Bel. How, my lord? Phi. She kisses thee? Bel. Never, my lord, by heaven. Phi. That’s strange; I know she does. Bel. No, by my life. Phi, Why then she does not love me. Come, she does. I bade her do it; I charg’d her, by all charms Of love between us, by the hope of peace We should enjoy, to yield thee all delights Naked as to her bed; I took her oath 795

706 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER Thou should’st enjoy her. Tell me, gentle boy, Is she not parallelless? Is not her breath Sweet as Arabian winds when fruits are ripe? Are not her breasts two liquid ivory balls? Is she not all a lasting mine of joy? Bel. Ay, now I see why my disturbed thoughts Were so perplex’d. When first I went to her, My heart held augury. You are abus’d; Some villain has abus’d you; I do see Whereto you tend. Fall rocks upon his head That put this to you! “Tis some subtle train To bring that noble frame of yours to nought. Phi. Thou think’st I will be angry with thee. Come, Thou shalt know all my drift. I hate her more Than I love happiness, and placed thee there To pry with narrow eyes into her deeds. Hast thou discovered? Is she fallen to lust, As I would wish her? Speak some comfort to me. Bel. My lord, you did mistake the boy you sent. Had she the lust of sparrows or of goats, Had she a sin that way, hid from the world, Beyond the name of lust, I would not aid Her base desires; but what I came to know As servant to her, I would not reveal, To make my life last ages. Phi. Oh, my heart! This is a salve worse than the main disease.— Tell me thy thoughts; for I will know the least That dwells within thee, or will rip thy heart To know it. I will see'thy thoughts as plain As I do now thy face. Bel. Why, so you do. She is (for aught I know) by all the gods, As chaste as ice! But were she foul as hell, And I did know it thus, the breath of kings, The points of swords, tortures, nor bulls of brass, Should draw it from me. Phi. Then it is no time

PHILASTER 707 To dally with thee; I will take thy life, For I do hate thee. I could curse thee now. Bel. If you do hate, you could not curse me worse; The gods have not a punishment in store Greater for me than is your hate. Phi. Fie, fie, So young and so dissembling! Tell me when And where thou didst enjoy her, or let plagues Fall on me, if I destroy thee not! He draws his sword. Bel. By heaven, I never did; and when I lie To save my life, may I live long and loath’d! Hew me asunder, and, whilst I can think, I'll love those pieces you have cut away Better than those that grow, and kiss those limbs Because you made ’em so. Phi. Fear’st thou not death? Can boys contemn that? Bel. Oh, what boy is he Can be content to live to be a man, That sees the best of men thus passionate, Thus without reason? Phi. Oh, but thou dost not know What ’tis to die. Bel. Yes, I do know, my lord: "Tis less than to be born; a lasting sleep; A quiet resting from all jealousy, A thing we all pursue. I know, besides, It is but giving over of a game That must be lost. Phi. But there are pains, false boy, For perjur’d souls. Think but on those, and then Thy heart will melt, and thou wilt utter all. Bel. May they fall all upon me whilst I live, If I be perjur’d, or have ever thought Of that you charge me with! If I be false, Send me to suffer in those punishments You speak of; kill me! Phi. Oh, what should I do?

708 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER Why, who can but believe him? He does swear So earnestly, that if it were not true, The gods would not endure him. Rise, Bellario: Thy protestations are so deep, and thou Dost look so truly when thou utter’st them, That, though I know ’em false as were my hopes, I cannot urge thee further. But thou wert To blame to injure me, for I must love Thy honest looks, and take no revenge upon Thy tender youth. A love from me to thee Is firm, whate’er thou dost; it troubles me That I have call’d the blood out of thy cheeks, That did so well become thee. But, good boy, Let me not see thee more: something is done That will distract me, that will make me mad, If I behold thee. If thou tender’st me, Let me not see thee. Bel. I will fly as far As there is morning, ere I give distaste To that most honour’d mind. But through these tears, Shed at my hopeless parting, I can see A world of treason practis’d upon you, And her, and me. Farewell for evermore! If you shall hear that sorrow struck me dead, And after find me loyal, let there be A tear shed from you in my memory, And I shall rest at peace. Exit, Phi. Blessing be with thee, Whatever thou deserv’st! Oh, where shall I Go bathe this body? Nature too unkind; That made no medicine for a troubled mind! Exit. [Scene II. Arethusa’s apartment in the palace] Enter ARETHUSA Are. I marvel my boy comes not back again: But that I know my love will question him

PHILASTER 709 Over and over,—how I slept, wak’d, talk’d, How I rememb’red him when his dear name Was last spoke, and how when I sigh’d, wept, sung, And ten thousand such,—I should be angry at his stay. Enter Kine King. What, at your meditations! Who attends you? Are. None but my single self. I need no guard; I do no wrong, nor fear none. King. Tell me, have you not a boy? Are. Yes, sir. King. What kind of boy? Are. A page, a waiting-boy. King. A handsome boy? Are. I think he be not ugly: Well qualified and dutiful I know him; I took him not for beauty. King. He speaks and sings and plays? Are. Yes, sir. King. About eighteen? Are. I never ask’d his age. King. Is he full of service? Are. By your pardon, why do you ask? King. Put him away. Are. Sir! King. Put him away, I say. H’as done you that good service shames me to speak of. Are. Good sir, let me understand you. King. If you fear me, Show it in duty; put away that boy. Are. Let me have reason for it, sir, and then Your will is my command. King. Do not you blush to ask it? Cast him off, Or I shall do the same to you. You're one Shame with me, and so near unto myself, That, by my life, I dare not tell myself What you, myself, have done.

710 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER Are. What have I done, my lord? King. ’Tis a new language, that all love to learn: The common people speak it well already; They need no grammar. Understand me well; There be foul whispers stirring. Cast him off, And suddenly. Do it! Farewell. Exit. Are, Where may a maiden live securely free, Keeping her honour fair? Not with the living. They feed upon opinions, errors, dreams, And make ’em truths; they draw a nourishment Out of defamings, grow upon disgraces, And, when they see a virtue fortified Strongly above the battery of their tongues, Oh, how they cast’ to sink it! and, defeated, (Soul-sick with poison) strike the monuments Where noble names lie sleeping, till they sweat, And the cold marble melt. Enter Putaster Phi. Peace to your fairest thoughts, dearest mistress! Are. Oh, my dearest servant,” I have a war within me! Phi. He must be more than man that makes these crystals Run into rivers. Sweetest fair, the cause? And, as I am your slave, tied to your goodness, Your creature, made again from what I was And newly-spirited, I’ll right your honour. Are. Oh, my best love, that boy! Phi. What boy? Are. The pretty boy you gave me— Phi. What of him? Are. Must be no more mine. Phi. Why? Are. They are jealous of him. Phi. Jealous! Who? Are. The King. 1 Plan. 2 Lover.

PHILASTER Phi. [ Aside.| Oh, my misfortune! Then ’tis no idle jealousy —Let him go. Are. Oh, cruel! Are you hard-hearted too? Who shall now tell you How much I lov’d you? Who shall swear it to you, And weep the tears I send? Who shall now bring you Letters, rings, bracelets? Lose his health in service? Wake tedious nights in stories of your praise? Who shall now sing your crying elegies, And strike a sad soul into senseless pictures, And make them mourn? Who shall take up his lute, And touch it till he crown a silent sleep Upon my eye-lids, making me dream, and cry, “Oh, my dear, dear Philaster!” Phi. [ Aside.] Oh, my heart! Would he had broken thee, that made me know This lady was not loyal!—Mistress, Forget the boy; I'll get thee a far better. Are. Oh, never, never such a boy again As my Bellario! Phi. "Tis but your fond affection. Are. With thee, my boy, farewell for ever All secrecy in servants! Farewell faith, And all desire to do well for itself! Let all that shall succeed thee for thy wrongs Sell and betray chaste love! Phi. And all this passion for a boy? Are. He was your boy, and you put him to me, And the loss of such must have a mourning for. Phi. Oh, thou forgetful woman! Are. How, my lord? Phi. False Arethusa! Hast thou a medicine to restore my wits, When I have lost em? If not, leave to talk, And do thus. Are. Do what, sir? Would you sleep? 711

7i2 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER Phi. For ever, Arethusa. Oh, you gods, Give me a worthy patience! Have I stood Naked, alone, the shock of many fortunes? Have I seen mischiefs numberless and mighty Grow like a sea upon me? Have I taken Danger as stern as death into my bosom, And laugh’d upon it, made it but a mirth, And flung it by? Do I live now like him, Under this tyrant King, that languishing Hears his sad bell and sees his mourners? Do I Bear all this bravely, and must sink at length Under a woman’s falsehood? Oh, that boy, That cursed boy! None but a villain boy To ease your lust? Are. Nay, then, I am betrayed: I feel the plot cast for my overthrow. Oh, I am wretched! Phi. Now you may take that little right I have To this poor kingdom. Give it to your joy; For I have no joy in it. Some far place, Where never womankind durst set her foot For* bursting with her poisons, must I seek, And live to curse you; There dig a cave, and preach to birds and beasts What woman is, and help to save them from you; How heaven is in your eyes, but in your hearts More hell than hell has; how your tongues, like scorpions, Both heal and poison;* how your thoughts are woven With thousand changes in one subtle web, And worn so by you; how that foolish man, That reads the story of a woman’s face And dies believing it, is lost for ever; How all the good you have is but a shadow, I’ the morning with you, and at night behind you, Past and forgotten; how your vows are frosts, 3 For fear of. : 41It was believed that scorpions, applied to the wound they made, cured it.

PHILASTER 713 Fast for a night, and with the next sun gone; How you are, being taken all together, A mere confusion, and so dead a chaos, That love cannot distinguish. These sad texts, Till my last hour, I am bound to utter of you. So, farewell all my woe, all my delight! Exit. Are. Be merciful, ye gods, and strike me dead! What way have I deserv’d this? Make my breast Transparent as pure crystal, that the world, Jealous of me, may see the foulest thought My heart holds. Where shall a woman turn her eyes, To find out constancy? Enter BELLARIO Save me, how black And guiltily, methinks, that boy looks now! Oh, thou dissembler, that, before thou spak’st, Wert in thy cradle false, sent to make lies And betray innocents! Thy lord and thou May glory in the ashes of a maid Fool’d by her passion; but the conquest is Nothing so great as wicked. Fly away! Let my command force thee to that which shame Would do without it. If thou understood’st The loathed office thou hast undergone, Why, thou wouldst hide thee under heaps of hills, Lest men should dig and find thee. Bel. Oh, what god, Angry with men, hath sent this strange disease Into the noblest minds! Madam, this grief You add unto me is no more than drops To seas, for which they are not seen to swell. My lord hath struck his anger through my heart, And let out all the hope of future joys. You need not bid me fly; I came to part, To take my latest leave. Farewell for ever! I durst not run away in honesty

Hasty time Reveal the truth to your abused lord And mine, that he may know your worth; whilst I Go seek out some forgotten place to die! Exit. Are. Peace guide thee! Thou hast overthrown me once; Yet, if I had another Troy to lose, Thou, or another villain with thy looks, Might talk me out of it, and send me naked, My hair dishevell’d, through the fiery streets. Enter a Lady Lady. Madam, the King would hunt, and calls for you With earnestness. Are. I am in tune to hunt! Diana, if thou canst rage with a maid As with a man,’ let me discover thee Bathing, and turn me to a fearful hind, That I may die pursued by cruel hounds, And have my story written in my wounds!

Oh, that I had been nourish’d in these woods With milk of goats and acorns, and not known The right of crowns nor the dissembling trains Of women’s looks; but digg’d myself a cave, Where I, my fire, my cattle, and my bed, Might have been shut together in one shed; And then had taken me some mountain-girl, Beaten with winds, chaste as the hard’ned rocks Whereon she dwelt, that might have strewed my bed With leaves and reeds, and with the skins of beasts, Our neighbours, and have borne at her big breasts My large coarse issue! This had been a life Free from vexation. Enter BELLARIO Bel. Oh, wicked men! An innocent may walk safe among beasts; Nothing assaults me here. See, my griev’d lord Sits as his soul were searching out a way To leave his body!—Pardon me, that must Break thy last commandment; for I must speak. You that are griev’d can pity; hear, my lord! Pf. Is there a creature yet so miserable, That I can pity? Bel. Oh, my noble lord, View my strange fortune, and bestow on me, According to your bounty (if my service Can merit nothing), so much as may serve To keep that little piece I hold of life From cold and hunger! Phi. Is it thou? Be gone! Go, sell those misbeseeming clothes thou wear’st, And feed thyself with them. i : ™) "4 S

718 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER Bel. Alas, my lord, I can get nothing for them! The silly country-people think ’tis treason To touch such gay things. Phi. Now, by the gods, this is Unkindly done, to vex me with thy sight. Thou’rt fallen again to thy dissembling trade; How shouldst thou think to cozen me again? Remains there yet a plague untried for me? Even so thou wept’st, and looked’st, and spok’st when first I took thee up. Curse on the time! If thy commanding tears Can work on any other, use thy art; I'll not betray it. Which way wilt thou take, That I may shun thee, for thine eyes are poison To mine, and I am loath to grow in rage; This way, or that way? Bel. Any will serve; but I will choose to have That path in chase that leads unto my grave. Exeunt severally. Enter [on one side] Dion, and [on the other| the two Woodmen Dion. This is the strangest sudden chance!—You, woodmen! 1st Wood. My lord Dion? Dion. Saw you a lady come this way on a sable horse studded with stars of white? 2nd Wood. Was she not young and tall? Dion. Yes. Rode she to the wood or to the plain? 2nd Wood. Faith, my lord, we saw none. Exeunt Woodmen. Dion. Pox of your questions then! Enter CLEREMONT / What, is she found? Cle. Nor will be, I think. | Dion. Let him seek his daughter himself. She cannot stray about — a little necessary natural business, but the whole court must be in | arms. When she has done, we shall have peace. Cle. There’s already a thousand fatherless tales amongst us. Some

PHILASTER 719 say, her horse ran away with her; some, a wolf pursued her; others, ‘twas a plot to kill her, and that arm’d men were seen in the wood: but questionless she rode away willingly. Enter Ki1nc, and 'THRASILINE King. Where is she? Cle. Sir, I cannot tell. King. How’s that? Answer me so again! Cle. Sir, shall I lie? King. Yes, lie and damn, rather than tell me that. I say again, where is she? Mutter not!— Sir, speak you; where is she? Dion. Sir, I do not know. King. Speak that again so boldly, and, by Heaven, It is thy last!—You, fellows, answer me; Where is she? Mark me, all; I am your King: I wish to see my daughter; show her me; I do command you all, as you are subjects, To show her me! What! am I not your King? If ay, then am I not to be obeyed? Dion. Yes, if you command things possible and honest. King. Things possible and honest! Hear me, thou,— Thou traitor, that dar’st confine thy King to things Possible and honest! Show her me, Or, let me perish, if I cover not All Sicily with blood! Dion. Faith, I cannot, Unless you tell me where she is. King. You have betray’d me; you have let me lose The jewel of my life. Go, bring her to me, And set her here before me. "Tis the King Will have it so; whose breath can still the winds, Uncloud the sun, charm down the swelling sea, And stop the floods of heaven. Speak, can it not? Dion. No.

720 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER King. No! cannot the breath of kings do this? Dion. No; nor smell sweet itself, if once the lungs Be but corrupted. King. Is it so? Take heed! Dion. Sir, take you heed how you dare the powers That must be just. King. Alas! what are we kings! Why do you gods place us above the rest, To be serv’d, flatter’d, and ador’d, till we Believe we hold within our hands your thunder? And when we come to try the power we have, There’s not a leaf shakes at our threatenings. I have sinn’d, ’tis true, and here stand to be punish’d; Yet would not thus be punish’d. Let me choose My way, and lay it on! Dion. | Astde:| He articles with the gods. Would somebody would draw bonds for the performance of covenants betwixt them! Enter PHARAMOND, GALATEA, and MEGRA King. What, is she found? Pha. No; we have ta’en her horse; He gallop’d empty by. There is some treason. You, Galatea, rode with her into the wood; Why left you her? Gal. She did command me. King. Command! you should not. Gal. ’Twould ill become my fortunes and my birth To disobey the daughter of my King. King. You're all cunning to obey us for our hurt; But I will have her. Pha. If I have her not, By this hand, there shall be no more Sicily. Dion. [ Aside.] What, will he carry it to Spain in’s pocket? Pha. I will not leave one man alive, but the King, A cook, and a tailor. King. [ Aside.] I see the injuries I have done must be reveng’d.

PHILASTER 721 Dion. Sir, this is not the way to find her out. King. Run all, disperse yourselves. The man that finds sal Or (if she be kill’d) the traitor, Pll make him great. Dion. I know some would give five thousand pounds to find her. Pha. Come, let us seek. King. Each man a several way; here I myself. Dion. Come, gentlemen, we here. Cle. Lady, you must go search too. Meg. I had rather be search’d myself. Exeunt [severally]. [Scene III. Another part of the forest] Enter ARETHUSA Are. Where am I now? Feet, find me out a way, Without the counsel of my troubled head. I'll follow you boldly about these woods, O’er mountains, thorough brambles, pits, and floods. Heaven, I hope, will ease me: I am sick. Sits down. Enter BELLARIO Bel. Yonder’s my lady. God knows I want nothing, Because I do not wish to live; yet I Will try her charity. [ Astde.]—Oh hear, you that have plenty! From that flowing store drop some on dry ground.—See, The lively red is gone to guard her heart! I fear she faints——Madam, look up!—She breathes not — Open once more those rosy twins, and send Unto my lord your latest farewell!—Oh, she stirs.— How is it, madam? speak comfort. Are. "Tis not gently done, To put me in a miserable life, And hold me there. I prithee, let me go; I shall do best without thee; I am well. Enter PHIasTer Phi. I am to blame to be so much in rage. I'll tell her coolly when and where I heard

722 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER This killing truth. I will be temperate In speaking, and as just in hearing —— Oh, monstrous! Tempt me not, you gods! good gods, ‘Tempt me not a frail man! What’s he, that has a heart, But he must ease it here! Bel. My lord, help, help! The princess! Are. 1 am well: forbear. Phi. [ Aside.] Let me love lightning, let me be embrac’d And kiss’d by scorpions, or adore the eyes Of basilisks, rather than trust the tongues Of hell-bred women! Some good god look down, And shrink these veins up! Stick me here a stone Lasting to ages in the memory Of this damn’d act!—Hear me, you wicked ones! You have put hills of fire into this breast, Not to be quench’d with tears; for which may guilt Sit on your bosoms! At your meals and beds Despair await you! What, before my face? Poison of asps between your lips! Diseases Be your best issues! Nature make a curse, And throw it on you! Are. Dear Philaster, leave To be enrag’d, and hear me. Phi. I have done; Forgive my passion. Not the calmed sea, When £olus locks up his windy brood, Is less disturb’d than I. T’ll make you know ’t. Dear Arethusa, do but take this sword, Offers his drawn sword. And search how temperate a heart I have; Then you and this your boy may live and reign In lust without control.—Wilt thou, Bellario? I prithee kill me; thou art poor, and may’st Nourish ambitious thoughts; when I am dead, Thy way were freer. Am I raging now? If I were mad, I should desire to live. Sirs,’ feel my pulse, whether you have known 1 Formerly used to women as well as to men.

PHILASTER 723 A man in a more equal tune to die. Bel. Alas, my lord, your pulse keeps madman’s time! So does your tongue. Phi. You will not kill me, then? Are. Kill you! Bel. Not for the world. Phi. I blame not thee, Bellario; thou hast done but that which gods Would have transform’d themselves to do. Be gone, Leave me without reply; this is the last Of all our meetings—Exit Bettario. Kill me with this sword; Be wise, or worse will follow: we are two Earth cannot bear at once. Resolve to do, Or suffer. Are. If-my fortune be so good to let me fall Upon thy hand, I shall have peace in death. Yet tell me this, will there be no slanders, No jealousy in the other world; no ill there? Phi. No. Are. Show me, then, the way. Phi. Then guide my feeble hand, You that have power to do it, for I must Perform a piece of justice!—If your youth Have any way offended Heaven, let prayers Short and effectual reconcile you to it. Are. I am prepared. Enter a Country Fellow C. Fell. T’ll see the King, if he be in the forest; I have hunted him these two hours. If I should come home and not see him, my sisters would laugh at me. I can see nothing but people better hors’d than myself, that out-ride me; I can hear nothing but shouting. These kings had need of good brains; this whooping is able to put a mean man out of his wits. There’s a courtier with his sword drawn; by this hand, upon a woman, I think! Phi. Are you at peace? Are. With heaven and earth.

724 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER Phi. May they divide thy soul and body! Wounds her. C. Fell. Hold, dastard! strike a woman! Thou’rt a craven, I warrant thee; thou wouldst be loth to play half a dozen venies? at wasters’ with a good fellow for a broken head. Phi. Leave us, good friend. Are. What ill-bred man art thou, to intrude thyself Upon our private sports, our recreation? C. Fell. God ’uds* me, I understand you not; but I know the rogue has hurt you. Phi. Pursue thy own affairs: it will be ill To multiply blood upon my head; which thou Wilt force me to. C. Fell. I know not your rhetoric; but I can lay it on, if you touch the woman. Phi. Slave, take what thou deservest! They fight. Are. Heavens guard my lord! C. Fell. Oh, do you breathe? Phi. 1 hear the tread of people. I am hurt. The gods take part against me: could this boor Have held me thus else? I must shift for life, Though I do loathe it. I would find a course To lose it rather by my will than force. Exit. C. Fell. I cannot follow the rogue. I pray thee, wench, come and kiss me now. Enter PHaRAMOND, Dion, CLEREMONT, THRASILINE, and Woodmen Pha. What art thou? C. Fell. Almost kill’d I am for a foolish woman; a knave has hurt her. Pha. The princess, gentlemen!—Where’s the wound, madam! Is it dangerous? Are. He has not hurt me. C. Fell. By God, she lies; h’as hurt her in the breast; Look else. 2 Bouts. %Cudgels. 4 God judge.

Dion. Ay. C. Fell. Then I have seen something yet. Pha. But who has hurt her? C. Fell. I told you, a rogue; I ne’er saw him before, I. Pha. Madam, who did it? Are. Some dishonest wretch; Alas, I know him not, and do forgive him! C. Fell. He’s hurt too; he cannot go far; I made my father’s old fox? fly about his ears. Pha. How will you have me kill him? Are. Not at all; ’tis some distracted fellow. Pha. By this hand, I'll leave ne’er a piece of him bigger than a nut, and bring him all to you in my hat. Are. Nay, good sir, If you do take him, bring him quick*® to me, And I will study for a punishment Great as his fault. Pha. I will. Are. But swear. Pha. By all my love, I will—— Woodmen, conduct the princess to the King, And bear that wounded fellow to dressing —— Come, gentlemen, we'll follow the chase close.

I have done ill; my conscience calls me false, To strike at her that would not strike at me. When I did fight, methought I heard her pray The gods to guard me. She may be abus’d, And [ a loathed villain; if she be, She will conceal who hurt her. He has wounds And cannot follow; neither knows he me. Who’s this? Bellario sleeping! If thou be’st Guilty, there is no justice that thy sleep Should be so sound, and mine, whom thou hast wrong’d, So broken. Cry within. Hark! Iam pursued. You gods I'll take this offer’d means of my escape. They have no mark to know me but my blood, If she be true; if false, let mischief light On all the world at once! Sword, print my wounds Upon this sleeping boy! I ha’ none, I think, Are mortal, nor would I lay greater on thee. Wounds BEt.ario. Bel. Oh, death, I hope, is come! Blest be that hand! It meant me well. Again, for pity’s sake! Phi. I have caught myself; Falls. The loss of blood hath stay’d my flight. Here, here, Is he that struck thee: take thy full revenge; 1 Sleepiness.

PHILASTER 727 Use me, as I did mean thee, worse than death; I’ll teach thee to revenge. This luckless hand Wounded the princess; tell my followers” Thou didst receive these hurts in staying me, And I will second thee; get a reward. Bel. Fly, fly, my lord, and save yourself! Phi. How’s this? Wouldst thou I should be safe? Bel. Else were it vain For me to live. These little wounds I have Ha’ not bled much. Reach me that noble hand; I'll help to cover you. Phi.. Art thou then true to me? Bel. Or let me perish loath’d! Come, my good lord, Creep in amongst those bushes; who does know But that the gods may save your much-lov’d breath? Phi. Then I shall die for grief, if not for this, That I have wounded thee. What wilt thou do? Bel. Shift for myself well. Peace! I hear em come. [ PuitasTER creeps into a bush.]| [Voices] within. Follow, follow, follow! that way they went. Bel. With my own wounds I'll bloody my own sword. I need not counterfeit to fall; Heaven knows That I can stand no longer. Falls.

A wretched creature, wounded in these woods By beasts. Relieve me, if your names be men, Or I shall perish. Dion. This is he, my lord, Upon my soul, that hurt her. Tis the boy, That wicked boy, that serv’d her. Pha. Oh, thou damn’d 2 Pursuers.

728 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER In thy creation! What cause couldst thou shape To hurt the princess? Bel. Then I am betrayed. Dion. Betrayed! No, apprehended. Bel. I confess, (Urge it no more) that, big with evil thoughts I set upon her, and did take my aim, Her death. For charity let fall at once The punishment you mean, and do not load This weary flesh with tortures. Pha.. I will know Who hir’d thee to this deed. Bel. Mine own revenge. Pha. Revenge! for what? Bel. It pleas’d her to receive Me as her page, and, when my fortunes ebb’d, That men strid o’er them careless, she did shower Her welcome graces on me, and did swell My fortunes till they overflow’d their banks, Threat’ning the men that crossed ’em; when, as swift As storms arise at sea, she turn’d her eyes To burning suns upon me, and did dry The streams she had bestow’d, leaving me worse And more contemn’d than other little brooks, Because I had been great. In short, I knew I could not live, and therefore did desire To die reveng’d. Pha. If tortures can be found Long as thy natural life, resolve to feel | The utmost rigour. | Cle. Help to lead him hence. | Puivaster creeps out of the bush. Phi. Turn back, you ravishers of innocence! Know ye the price of that you bear away So rudely? Pha. Who’s that? Dion. ’Tis the Lord Philaster.

PHILASTER Phi. ’Tis not the treasure of all kings in one, The wealth of Tagus, nor the rocks of pearl That pave the court of Neptune, can weigh down That virtue. It was I that hurt the princess. Place me, some god, upon a pyramis* Higher than hills of earth, and lend a voice Loud as your thunder to me, that from thence I may discourse to all the under-world The worth that dwells in him! Pha. How’s this? Bel. Weary of life, that would be glad to die. Phi. Leave these untimely courtesies, Bellario. 729 My lord, some man Bel. Alas, he’s mad! Come, will you lead me on? Phi. By all the oaths that men ought most to keep, And gods to punish most when men do break, He touch’d her not.—Take heed, Bellario, How thou dost drown the virtues thou hast shown With perjury.—By all that’s good, ’twas I! You know she stood betwixt me and my right. Pha. Thy own tongue be thy judge! Cle. It was Philaster. Dion. Is’t not a brave boy? Well, sirs, I fear me we were all deceived. Phi. Have I no friend here? Dion. Yes, Phi. Then show it: some '\Good body lend a hand to draw us nearer. ‘Would you have tears shed for you when you die? ‘Then lay me gently on. his neck, that there ‘I may weep floods and breathe forth my spirit. ’Tis not the wealth of Plutus, nor the gold |Lock’d in the heart of earth, can buy away ‘This arm-full from me; this had been a ransom “To have redeemed the Great Augustus Cesar, \Had he been taken.

Sir, they did plot together to take hence This harmless life; should it pass unreveng’d, I should to earth go weeping. Grant me, then, By all the love a father bears his child, Their custodies, and that I may appoint Their tortures and their deaths. Dion. Death! Soft; our law will not reach that for this fault. King.

Iam a man False to a pair of the most trusty ones That ever earth bore; can it bear us all? Forgive, and leave me. But the King hath sent To call me to my death: oh, shew it me, And then forget me!

Alas, my lord, my life is not a thing Worthy your noble thoughts! ’Tis not a life, "Tis but a piece of childhood thrown away.

Right royal sir, I should Sing you an epithalamion of these lovers, But having lost my best airs with my fortunes, And wanting a celestial harp to strike This blessed union on, thus in glad story I give you all. These two fair cedar-branches The noblest of the mountain where they grew, Straightest and tallest, under whose still shades The worthier beasts have made their lairs, and slept Free from the fervour of the Sirian star And the fell thunder-stroke, free from the clouds, When they were big with humour, and deliver’d, In thousand spouts their issues to the earth; Oh, there was none but silent quiet there! Till never-pleased Fortune shot up shrubs, Base under-brambles, to divorce these branches; And for a while they did so, and did reign Over the mountain, and choke up his beauty With brakes, rude thorns and thistles, till the sun Scorch’d them even to the roots and dried them there. And now a gentle gale hath blown again, That made these branches meet and twine together, Never to be divided. The god that sings His holy numbers over marriage-beds Hath knit their noble hearts; and here they stand Your children, mighty King: and I have done. King. How, how? Are. Sir, if you love it in plain truth, (For now there is no masquing in’t,) this gentleman, The prisoner that you gave me, is become My keeper, and through all the bitter throes Your jealousies and his ill fate have wrought him, Thus nobly hath he struggled, and at length

Blood shall put out your torches; and, instead Of gaudy flowers about your wanton necks, An axe shall hang, like a prodigious meteor, Ready to crop your loves’ sweets. Hear, you gods! From this time do I shake all title off Of father to this woman, this base woman; And what there is of vengeance in a lion Chaf’d among dogs or robb’d of his dear young, The same, enforc’d more terrible, more mighty, Expect from me! Are. Sir, by that little life I have left to swear by, There’s nothing that can stir me from myself.

Dion. | Aside.| Sweet peace upon thy soul, thou worthy maid, Whene’er thou diest! For this time I'll excuse thee, Or be thy prologue. Phi. Sir, let me speak next; And let my dying words be better with you Than my dull living actions. If you aim At the dear life of this sweet innocent, _ You are a tyrant and a savage monster, That feeds upon the blood you gave a life to; Your memory shall be as foul behind you, As you are living; all your better deeds Shall be in water writ, but this in marble; No chronicle shall speak you, though your own, _ But for the shame of men. No monument, _ Though high and big as Pelion, shall be able

And for after-issues, Think not so madly of the heavenly wisdoms, That they will give you more for your mad rage To cut off, unless it be some snake, or something Like yourself, that in his birth shall strangle you. Remember my father, King! There was a fault, But I forgive it. Let that sin persuade you To love this lady; if you have a soul, Think, save her, and be saved.

A plague upon myself, a thousand plagues, For having such unworthy thoughts of her dear honour! Oh, I could beat myself! Or do you beat me, And I'll beat you; for we had all one thought. Cle. No, no, twill but lose time. Dion. You say true. Are your swords sharp?—Well, my dear countrymen What-ye-lacks,” if you continue, and fall not back upon the first broken skin, I'll have you chronicled and chronicled, and cut and chronicled, and all-to-be-prais’d and sung in sonnets, and bawled in new brave ballads, that all tongues shall troll you in secula seculorum, my kind can-carriers. Thra. What, if a toy’ take ’em i’ the heels now, and they run all away, and cry, “the devil take the hindmost”? Dion. Then the same devil take the foremost too, and souse him for his breakfast! If they all prove cowards, my curses fly amongst them, and be speeding! May they have murrains reign to keep the gentlemen at home unbound in easy frieze! May the moths branch* their velvets, and their silks only to be worn before sore eyes! May their false lights undo ’em, and discover presses,’ holes, stains, and oldness in their stuffs, and make them shop-rid! May they keep whores and horses, and break; and live mewed up with necks of beef and turnips! May they have many children, and none like the father! May they know no language but that gibberish they prattle to their parcels, unless it be the goatish Latin they write in their bonds—and may they write that false, and lose their debts! 21. e., shopkeepers, who were in the habit of thus addressing passers-by. 3 Trifle, whim. ‘4Eat patterns on. 5 Creases.

They will not hear me speak, but fling dirt at me and call me tyrant. Oh, run, dear friend, and bring the Lord Philaster!

Oh, worthy sir, forgive me! Do not make Your miseries and my faults meet together, To bring a greater danger. Be yourself, Still sound amongst diseases. I have wrong’d you; And though I find it last, and beaten to it, Let first your goodness know it. Calm the people, And be what you were born to.

744 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER [Scene V. An apartment in the palace| Enter Kinc, AretHusa, GaLatea, Mecra, Dion, CLEREMONT, THRASILINE, BELLARIO, and Attendants King. Is it appeas’d? Dion. Sir, all is quiet as this dead of night, As peaceable as sleep. My lord Philaster Brings on the prince himself. King. Kind gentleman! I will not break the least word I have given In promise to him. I have heap’d a world Of grief upon his head, which yet I hope To wash away. Enter Puiwaster and PHARAMOND Cle. My lord is come. King. My son! Blest be the time that I have leave to call Such virtue mine! Now thou art in mine arms, Methinks I have a salve unto my breast For all the stings that dwell there. Streams of grief That I have wrong’d thee, and as much of joy That I repent it, issue from mine eyes; Let them appease thee. Take thy right; take her; She is thy right too; and forget to urge My vexed soul with that I did before. Phi. Sir, it is blotted from my memory, Past and forgotten—For you, prince of Spain, Whom I have thus redeem’d, you have full leave To make an honourable voyage home. And if you would go furnish’d to your realm With fair provision, I do see a lady, Methinks, would gladly bear you company. How like you this piece? Meg. Sir, he likes it well, For he hath tried it, and hath found it worth His princely liking. We were ta’en abed;

} PHILASTER I know your meaning. I am not the first That nature taught to seek a fellow forth; Can shame remain perpetually in me, And not in others? Or have princes salves To cure ill names, that meaner people want? Phi. What mean you? | Meg. You must get another ship, To bear the princess and her boy together. Dion. How now! Meg. Others took me, and I took her and him. Ship us all four, my lord; we can endure Weather and wind alike. King. Clear thou thyself, or know not me for father. Are. This earth, how false it is! What means is left for me To clear myself? It lies in your belief. My lords, believe me; and let all things else Struggle together to dishonour me. Bel. Oh, stop your ears, great King, that I may speak As freedom would! Then I will call this lady As base as are her actions. Hear me, sir; Believe your heated blood when it rebels Against your reason, sooner than this lady. Meg. By this good light, he bears it handsomely. Phi. This lady! I will sooner trust the wind With feathers, or the troubled sea with pearl, Than her with any thing. Believe her not. Why, think you, if I did believe her words, I would outlive em? Honour cannot take Revenge on you; then what were to be known But death? King. Forget her, sir, since all is knit Between us. But I must request of you One favour, and will sadly* be denied. Phi. Command, whate’er it be. King. Swear to be true To what you promise. 1 Shall be sorry to be denied. 745

746 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER Phi. By the powers above, Let it not be the death of her or him, And it is granted! King. Bear away that boy To torture; I will have her clear’d or buried. Phi, Oh, let me call my word back, worthy sir! Ask something else: bury my life and right In one poor grave; but do not take away My life and fame at once. King. Away with him! It stands irrevocable. P/i. Turn all your eyes on me. Here stands a man, The falsest and the basest of this world. Set swords against this breast, some honest man, For I have liv’d till I am pitied! My former deeds were hateful; but this last Is pitiful, for I unwillingly Have given the dear preserver of my life Unto his torture. Is it in the power Of flesh and blood to carry this, and live? Offers to stab himself. Are. Dear sir, be patient yet! Oh, stay that hand! King. Sirs, strip that boy. Dion. Come, sir; your tender flesh Will try your constancy. Bel. Oh, kill me, gentlemen! Dion. No.—Help, sirs. Bel. Will you torture me? King. Haste there; Why stay you? Bel. Then I shall not break my vow, You know, just gods, though I discover all. King. How’s that? Will he confess? Dion. Sir, so he says. King. Speak then. Bel. Great King, if you command This lord to talk with me alone, my tongue, Urg’d by my heart, shall utter all the thoughts

PHILASTER 747 My youth hath known; and stranger things than these You hear not often. King. Walk aside with him. [Dion and Betxario walk apart. | Dion. Why speak’st thou not? Bel. Know you this face, my lord? Dion. No. Bel. Have you not seen it, nor the like? Dion. Yes, I have seen the like, but readily I know not where. Bel. I have been often told In court of one Euphrasia, a lady, And daughter to you; betwixt whom and me They that would flatter my bad face would swear There was such strange resemblance, that we two Could not be known asunder, drest alike. Dion. By Heaven, and so there is! ® \ Bel, For her fair sake, Who now doth spend the spring-time of her life In holy pilgrimage, move to the King, That I may scape this torture. Dion. But thou speak’st As like Euphrasia as thou dost look. How came it to thy knowledge that she lives In pilgrimage? Bel. I know it not, my lord; But I have heard it, and do scarce believe it. Dion. Oh, my shame! is it possible? Draw near, That I may gaze upon thee. Art thou she, Or else her murderer?’ Where wert thou born? Bel. In Syracusa. Dion. What’s thy name? Bel. Euphrasia. Dion. Oh, ’tis just, ’tis she! 2In some barbarous countries, it was believed that the murderer inherited the form and qualities of his victim.—Mason.

748 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER Now I do know thee. Oh, that thou hadst died, And I had never seen thee nor my shame! How shall I own thee? Shall this tongue of mine EF’er call thee daughter more? Bel. Would I had died indeed! I wish it too; And so I must have done by vow, ere publish’d What I have told, but that there was no means To hide it longer. Yet I joy in this, The princess is all clear. King. What, have you done? Dion. All is discovered. Phi. Why then hold you me? All is discovered! Pray you, let me go. Offers to stab himself. King. Stay him. Are. What is discovered? Dion. Why, my shame. It is a woman: let her speak the rest. Pht. How? That again! Dion. It is a woman. P/1. Blessed be you powers that favour innocence! King. Lay hold upon that lady. [ Mzcra zs seized. | Pf, It is a woman, sir!—Hark, gentlemen, It is a woman!—Arethusa, take My soul into thy breast, that would be gone With joy. It isa woman! Thou art fair, And virtuous still to ages, in despite Of malice. King. Speak you, where lies his shame? Bel. I am his daughter. Phi. The gods are just. Dion. I dare accuse none; but, before you two, The virtue of our age, I bend my knee For mercy. [ Kneels.| Phi. [raising him| Take it freely; for I know, Though what thou didst were undiscreetly done, "Twas meant well. Are. And for me, I have a power to pardon sins, as oft

PHILASTER 749 As any man has power to wrong me. Cle. Noble and worthy! Phi. But, Bellario, (For I must call thee still so,) tell me why Thou didst conceal thy sex. It was a fault, A fault, Bellario, though thy other deeds Of truth outweigh’d it: all these jealousies Had flown to nothing, if thou hadst discovered What now we know. Bel. My father oft would speak Your worth and virtue; and, as I did grow More and more apprehensive,’ I did thirst To see the man so prais’d. But yet all this Was but a maiden-longing, to be lost As soon as found; till, sitting in my window, Printing my thoughts in lawn, I saw a god, I thought, (but it was you,) enter our gates. My blood flew out and back again, as fast As I had puff’d it forth and suck’d it in Like breath. Then was I called away in haste To entertain you. Never was a man, Heav’d from a sheep-cote to a sceptre, rais’d So high in thoughts as I. You left a kiss Upon these lips then, which I mean to keep From you for ever. I did hear you talk, Far above singing. After you were gone, I grew acquainted with my heart, and search’d What stirred it so: alas, I found it love! Yet far from lust; for, could I but have liv’d In presence of you, I had had my end. For this I did delude my noble father With a feign’d pilgrimage, and dress’d myself In habit of a boy; and, for I knew My birth no match for you, I was past hope Of having you; and, understanding well That when I made discovery of my sex - Icould not stay with you, I made a vow, 3 Quick to understand.

750 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER By all the most religious things a maid Could call together, never to be known, Whilst there was hope to hide me from men’s eyes, For other than I seem’d, that I might ever Abide with you. Then sat I by the fount, Where first you took me up. King. Search out a match Within our kingdom, where and when thou wilt, And I will pay thy dowry; and thyself Wilt well deserve him. Bel. Never, sir, will I Marry; it is a thing within my vow: But, if I may have leave to serve the princess, To see the virtues of her lord and her, I shall have hope to live. Are. I, Philaster, Cannot be jealous, though you had a lady Drest like a page to serve you; nor will I Suspect her living here—Come, live with me; Live free as I do. She that loves my lord, Curs’d be the wife that hates her! Phi. 1 grieve such virtue should be laid in earth Without an heir—Hear me, my royal father: Wrong not the freedom of our souls so much, To think to take revenge of that base woman; Her malice cannot hurt us. Set her free As she was born, saving from shame and sin. King. Set her at liberty—But leave the court; This is no place for such—You, Pharamond, Shall have free passage, and a conduct home Worthy so great a prince. When you come there, Remember ’twas your faults that lost you her, And not my purpos’d will. Pha. I do confess, Renowned sir. King. Last, join your hands in one. Enjoy, Philaster,

& PHILASTER © This kingdom, which is yours, and, after me, _ Whatever I call mine. My blessing on you! All happy hours be at your marriage-joys, _ That you may grow yourselves over all lands, And live to see your plenteous branches spring — _ Wherever there is sun! Let princes learn By this to rule the passions of their blood; _ For what Heaven wills can never be withstood. Exeunt omnes.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE Or John Webster’s life almost nothing is known. The dates 15801625 given for his birth and death are conjectural inferences, about which the best that can be said is that no known facts contradict them. The first notice of Webster so far discovered shows that he was collaborating in the production of plays for the theatrical manager, Henslowe, in 1602, and of such collaboration he seems to have done a considerable amount. Four plays exist which he wrote alone, “The White Devil,” “The Duchess of Malfi,” “The Devil’s Law-Case,” and “Appius and Virginia.” “The Duchess of Malfi” was published in 1623, but the date of writing may have been as early as 1611. It is based on a story in Painter’s “Palace of Pleasure,” translated from the Italian novelist, Bandello; and it is entirely possible that it has a foundation in fact. In any case, it portrays with a terrible vividness one side of the court life of the Italian Renaissance; and its picture of the fierce quest of pleasure, the recklessness of crime, and the worldliness of the great princes of the Church finds only too ready corroboration in the annals of the time. Webster’s tragedies come toward the close of the great series of tragedies of blood and revenge, in which “The Spanish Tragedy” and “Hamlet” are landmarks, but before decadence can fairly be said to have set in. He, indeed, loads his scene with horrors almost past the point which modern taste can bear; but the intensity of his dramatic situations, and his superb power of flashing in a single line a light into the recesses of the human heart at the crises of supreme emotion, redeems him from mere sensationalism, and places his best things in the first rank of dramatic writing.

Ant. I admire it: In seeking to reduce both state and people To a fix’d order, their judicious king Begins at home; quits first his royal palace Of flattering sycophants, of dissolute And infamous persons,—which he sweetly terms His master’s master-piece, the work of heaven; Considering duly that a prince’s court Is like a common fountain, whence should flow Pure silver drops in general, but if ’t chance Some curs’d example poison ’t near the head, 755

756 JOHN WEBSTER Death and diseases through the whole land spread. And what is ’t makes this blessed government But a most provident council, who dare freely Inform him the corruption of the times? Though some o’ the court hold it presumption To instruct princes what they ought to do, It is a noble duty to inform them What they ought to foresee.-—Here comes Bosola, The only court-gall; yet I observe his railing Is not for simple love of piety: Indeed, he rails at those things which he wants; Would be as lecherous, covetous, or proud, Bloody, or envious, as any man, If he had means to be so.—Here’s the cardinal. [Enter Carvinat and Bosora | Bos. I do haunt you still. Card. So. Bos. I have done you better service than to be slighted thus. Miserable age, where only the reward of doing well is the doing of it! Card. You enforce your merit too much. Bos. I fell into the galleys in your service; where, for two years together, I wore two towels instead of a shirt, with a knot on the shoulder, after the fashion of a Roman mantle. Slighted thus! I will thrive some way. Black-birds fatten best in hard weather; why not I in these dog-days? Card. Would you could become honest! Bos. With all your divinity do but direct me the way to it. I have known many travel far for it, and yet return as arrant knaves as they went forth, because they carried themselves always along with them. [Exit Carprnat.] Are you gone? Some fellows, they say, are possessed with the devil, but this great fellow were able to possess the greatest devil, and make him worse. Ant. He hath denied thee some suit? Bos. He and his brother are like plum-trees that grow crooked — over standing-pools; they are rich and o’erladen with fruit, but none 1 Prevent. ? {

THE DUCHESS OF MALFI 757 but crows, pies, and caterpillars feed on them. Could I be one of their flattering panders, I would hang on their ears like a horseleech, till I were full, and then drop off. I pray, leave me. Who would rely upon these miserable dependencies, in expectation to be advanc’d to-morrow? What creature ever fed worse than hoping Tantalus? Nor ever died any man more fearfully than he that hoped for a pardon. There are rewards for hawks and dogs when they have done us service; but for a soldier that hazards his limbs in a battle, nothing but a kind of geometry is his last supportation. Delio. Geometry? Bos. Ay, to hang in a fair pair of slings, take his latter swing in the world upon an honourable pair of crutches, from hospital to hospital. Fare ye well, sir: and yet do not you scorn us; for places in the court are but like beds in the hospital, where this man’s head lies at that man’s foot, and so lower and lower. [ Exit. | Del. I knew this fellow seven years in the galleys For a notorious murder; and ’twas thought The cardinal suborn’d it: he was releas’d By the French general, Gaston de Foix, When he recover’d Naples. Ant. "Tis great pity He should be thus neglected: I have heard He ’s very valiant. This foul melancholy Will poison all his goodness; for, I'll tell you, If too immoderate sleep be truly said To be an inward rust unto the soul, It then doth follow want of action Breeds all black malcontents; and their close rearing, Like moths in cloth, do hurt for want of wearing.

Give him the jewel—When shall we leave this sportive action, and fall to action indeed? Cast. Methinks, my lord, you should not desire to go to war in person. Ferd. Now for some gravity —Why, my lord? Cast. It is fitting a soldier arise to be a prince, but not necessary a prince descend to be a captain. Ferd. No? Cast. No, my lord; he were far better do it by a deputy. Ferd. Why should he not as well sleep or eat by a deputy? This might take idle, offensive, and base office from him, whereas the other deprives him of honour. Cast. Believe my experience, that realm is never long in quiet where the ruler is a soldier. Ferd. Thou toldest me thy wife could not endure fighting. Cast. True, my lord. Ferd. And of a jest she broke of’ a captain she met full of wounds: I have forgot it. Cast.

Gris. Ha, ha, ha! Ferd. Why do you laugh? Methinks you that are courtiers should be my touch-wood, take fire when I give fire; that is, laugh when I laugh, were the subject never so witty. Cast. True, my lord: I myself have heard a very good jest, and have scorn’d to seem to have so silly a wit as to understand it. Ferd. But I can laugh at your fool, my lord. Cast. He cannot speak, you know, but he makes faces; my lady cannot abide him. Ferd. No? Cast. Nor endure to be in merry company; for she says too much laughing, and too much company, fills her too full of the wrinkle. Ferd. I would, then, have a mathematical instrument made for her face, that she might not laugh out of compass.—I shall shortly visit you at Milan, Lord Silvio. Sil. Your grace shall arrive most welcome. Ferd. You are a good horseman, Antonio: you have excellent riders in France: what do you think of good horsemanship? Ant. Nobly, my lord: as out of the Grecian horse issued many famous princes, so out of brave horsemanship arise the first sparks of growing resolution, that raise the mind to noble action. Ferd. You have bespoke it worthily. Sil. Your brother, the lord cardinal, and sister duchess. | Enter CarpinaL, with Ducuess, and CarioLa] Card. Are the galleys come about? Gris. They are, my lord. Ferd. Here’s the Lord Silvio is come to take his leave. Delio. Now, sir, your promise: what’s that cardinal? I mean his temper? They say he’s a brave fellow, Will play his five thousand crowns at tennis, dance, Court ladies, and one that hath fought single combats. Ant. Some such flashes superficially hang on him for form; but 6 Ballasted.

760 JOHN WEBSTER observe his inward character: he is a melancholy churchman. The spring in his face is nothing but the engend’ring of toads; where he is jealous of any man, he lays worse plots for them than ever was impos’d on Hercules, for he strews in his way flatterers, panders, intelligencers, atheists, and a thousand such political monsters. He should have been Pope; but instead of coming to it by the primitive decency of the church, he did bestow bribes so largely and so impudently as if he would have carried it away without heaven’s knowledge. Some good he hath done—— Delio. You have given too much of him. What’s his Lioihiee? Ant. The duke there? A most perverse and turbulent nature. What appears in him mirth is merely outside; If he laught heartily, it is to laugh All honesty out of fashion. Delio. Twins? Ant. In quality. He speaks with others’ tongues, and hears men’s suits With others’ ears; will seem to sleep o’ the bench Only to entrap offenders in their answers; Dooms men to death by information; Rewards by hearsay. : Delio. Then the law to him Is like a foul, black cobweb to a spider,— He makes it his dwelling and a prison To entangle those shall feed him. Ant. Most true: He never pays debts unless they be shrewd turns, And those he will confess that he doth owe. Last, for his brother there, the cardinal, They that do flatter him most say oracles Hang at his lips; and verily I believe them, For the devil speaks in them. But for their sister, the right noble duchess, You never fix’d your eye on three fair medals Cast in one figure, of so different temper. For her discourse, it is so full of rapture, You only will begin then to be sorry

THE DUCHESS OF MALFI 761 When she doth end her speech, and wish, in wonder, She held it less vain-glory to talk much, Than your penance to hear her. Whilst she speaks, She throws upon a man so sweet a look That it were able to raise one to a galliard’ That lay in a dead palsy, and to dote On that sweet countenance; but in that look There speaketh so divine a continence As cuts off all lascivious and vain hope. Her days are practis’d in such noble virtue, That sure her nights, nay, more, her very sleeps, Are more in heaven than other ladies’ shrifts. Let all sweet ladies break their flatt’ring glasses, And dress themselves in her. Delio. Fie, Antonio, You play the wire-drawer with her commendations. Ant. V'll case the picture up: only thus much; All her particular worth grows to this sum,— She stains® the time past, lights the time to come. Cari. You must attend my lady in the gallery, Some half an hour hence. Ant. I shall. [Exeunt Antonio and Det1o.| Ferd. Sister, I have a suit to you. Duch. To me, sir? Ferd.

There’s no more credit to be given to the face Than to a sick man’s urine, which some call The physician’s whore, because she cozens” him. He did suspect me wrongfully. Ferd. For that You must give great men leave to take their times. Distrust doth cause us seldom be deceiv’d. You see the oft shaking of the cedar-tree Fastens it more at root. Bos.

O, that to avoid ingratitude For the good deed you have done me, I must do All the ill man can invent! Thus the devil Candies all sins o’er; and what heaven terms vile, That names he complimental. Ferd. Be yourself; Keep your old garb of melancholy; ’twill express You envy those that stand above your reach, Yet strive not to come near ’em.

So most widows say; But commonly that motion lasts no longer Than the turning of an hour-glass: the funeral sermon And it end both together. Ferd. Now hear me: You live in a rank pasture, here, i’ the court; There is a kind of honey-dew that’s deadly; Twill poison your fame; look to ’t. Be not cunning; For they whose faces do belie their hearts Are witches ere they arrive at twenty years, Ay, and give the devil suck. Duch. This is terrible good counsel. Ferd. Hypocrisy is woven of a fine small thread, Subtler than Vulcan’s engine:’ yet, believe ’t, Your darkest actions, nay, your privat’st thoughts, Will come to light. Card. You may flatter yourself, And take your own choice; privately be married Under the eaves of night—— Ferd.

I'd be loth to see’t look rusty, ’cause ’twas his. I would have you give o’er these chargeable revels: A visor and a mask are whispering-rooms That were never built for goodness,—fare ye well— And women like variety of courtship. What cannot a neat knave with a smooth tale Make a woman believe? Farewell, lusty widow. [ Exit. | Duch. Shall this move me? If all my royal kindred Lay in my way unto this marriage, I’d make them my low footsteps. And even now, Even in this hate, as men in some great battles, By apprehending danger, have achiev’d Almost impossible actions (I have heard soldiers say so), So I through frights and threatenings will assay This dangerous venture. Let old wives report I wink’d and chose a husband.—Cariola, To thy known secrecy I have given up More than my life,—my fame. Cari.

I look young for your sake; You have ta’en my cares upon you. Ant. I'll fetch your grace The particulars of your revenue and expense. Duch. O, you are An upright treasurer: but you mistook; For when I said I meant to make inquiry What’s laid up for to-morrow, I did mean What’s laid up yonder for me. Ant. Where? Duch. In heaven. Iam making my will (as ’tis fit princes should, In perfect memory), and, I pray, sir, tell me, Were not one better make it smiling, thus, Than in deep groans and terrible ghastly looks, As if the gifts we parted with procur’d’ _ That violent distraction?

Yes, your excellent self. Duch. In a winding-sheet? Ant. In a couple. Duch. Saint Winifred, that were a strange will! Ant. *Twere stranger® if there were no will in you To marry again. Duch. What do you think of marriage? Ant. I take ’t, as those that deny purgatory, It locally contains or heaven or hell; There’s no third place in’t. Duch. How do you affect it? Ant. My banishment, feeding my melancholy, Would often reason thus. Duch. Pray, let’s hear it. Ant. Say a man never marry, nor have children, What takes that from him? Only the bare name Of being a father, or the weak delight To see the little wanton ride a-cock-horse Upon a painted stick, or hear him chatter Like a taught starling. Duch. Fie, fie, what’s all this? One of your eyes is blood-shot; use my ring to ’t. They say ’tis very sovereign. "Twas my wedding-ring, And I did vow never to part with it But to my second husband. Ant. You have parted with it now. Duch. Yes, to help your eye-sight. Ant. You have made me stark blind. 6 Quartos read strange.

Sir, This goodly roof of yours is too low built; I cannot stand upright in ’t nor discourse, Without I raise it higher. Raise yourself; Or, if you please, my hand to help you: so. [Raises him.| Ant. Ambition, madam, is a great man’s madness, That is not kept in chains and close-pent rooms, But in fair lightsome lodgings, and is girt With the wild noise of prattling visitants, Which makes it lunatic beyond all cure.

So, now the ground’s broke, You may discover what a wealthy mine I make you lord of. Ant. O my unworthiness! Duch. You were ill to sell yourself: This dark’ning of your worth is not like that Which tradesmen use i’ the city; their false lights Are to rid bad wares off: and I must tell you, If you will know where breathes a complete man (I speak it without flattery), turn your eyes, And progress through yourself. Ant. Were there nor heaven nor hell, I should be honest: I have long serv’d virtue, 7 Guess.

We are forc’d to woo, because none dare woo us; And asa tyrant doubles with his words, And fearfully equivocates, so we Are forc’d to express our violent passions In riddles and in dreams, and leave the path Of simple virtue, which was never made To seem the thing it is not. Go, go brag You have left me heartless; mine is in your bosom: I hope ’twill multiply love there. You do tremble: Make not your heart so dead a piece of flesh, To fear more than to love me. Sir, be confident: What is ’t distracts you? This is flesh and blood, sir; "Tis not the figure cut in alabaster Kneels at my husband’s tomb. Awake, awake man! I do here put off all vain ceremony, And only do appear to you a young widow That claims you for her husband, and, like a widow, I use but half a blush in ’t. Ant. Truth speak for me; I will remain the constant sanctuary Of your good name. Duch. I thank you, gentle love: And ’cause you shall not come to me in debt, Being now my steward, here upon your lips I sign your Quietus est. This you should have begg’d now. I have seen children oft eat sweetmeats thus, As fearful to devour them too soon. Ant. But for your brothers? Duch.

How can the church build faster?” We now are man and wife, and ’tis the church That must but echo this——Maid, stand apart: I now am blind. Ant. What’s your conceit in this? Duch.

Let me see: you have a reasonable good face for ’t already, and your night-cap expresses your ears sufficient largely. I would have you learn to twirl the strings of your band with a good grace, and in a set speech, at th’ end of every sentence, to hum three or four times, or blow your nose till it smart again, to recover your memory. When you come to be a president in criminal causes, if you smile upon a prisoner, hang him; but if you frown upon him and threaten him, let him be sure to scape the gallows. Cast. I would be a very merry president. Bos. Do not sup o’ nights; "twill beget you an admirable wit. Cast. Rather it would make me have a good stomach to quarrel; for they say, your roaring boys eat meat seldom, and that makes them so valiant. But how shall I know whether the people take me for an eminent fellow? Bos. I will teach a trick to know it: give out you lie a-dying, and if you hear the common people curse you, be sure you are taken for one of the prime night-caps.’ [Enter an Old Lady] You come from painting now. Old Lady. From what? Bos. Why, from your scurvy face-physic. To behold thee not painted inclines somewhat near a miracle. These in thy face here 1Chief part. Bullies (Hazlitt); lawyers (Vaughan).

It seems you are well acquainted with my closet. Bos. One would suspect it for a shop of witchcraft, to find in it the fat of serpents, spawn of snakes, Jews’ spittle, and their young children’s ordure; and all these for the face. I would sooner eat a dead pigeon taken from the soles of the feet of one sick of the plague, than kiss one of you fasting. Here are two of you, whose sin of your youth is the very patrimony of the physician; makes him renew his foot-cloth with the spring, and change his high-pric’d courtezan with the fall of the leaf. I do wonder you do not loathe yourselves. Observe my meditation now. What thing is in this outward form of man To be belov’d? We account it ominous, If nature do produce a colt, or lamb, A fawn, or goat, in any limb resembling A man, and fly from ’t as a prodigy: Man stands amaz’d to see his deformity In any other creature but himself. But in our own flesh though we bear diseases Which have their true names only ta’en from beasts,— As the most ulcerous wolf and swinish measle,— Though we are eaten up of lice and worms, And though continually we bear about us A rotten and dead body, we delight To hide it in rich tissue: all our fear, Nay, all our terror, is, lest our physician Should put us in the ground to be made sweet — Your wife’s gone to Rome: you two couple, and get you to the wells 3 Royal journey. 4 Turning a boat on its side for repairs. 5Scabbed. © Empty. 7 Face-modeling (Sampson). ‘There’s a plain statement of your practises.”

Let me seal your lips for ever: For, did I think that anything but th’ air Could carry these words from you, I should wish You had no breath at all——Now, sir, in your contemplation? You are studying to become a great wise fellow. Bos. O, sir, the opinion of wisdom is a foul tetter® that runs all over a man’s body: if simplicity direct us to have no evil, it directs us to a happy being; for the subtlest folly proceeds from the subtlest wisdom: let me be simply honest. Ant. I do understand your inside. Bos. Do you so? Ant. Because you would not seem to appear to th’ world Puff'd up with your preferment, you continue This out-of-fashion melancholy: leave it, leave it. Bos. Give me leave to be honest in any phrase, in any compliment whatsoever. Shall I confess myself to you? I look no higher than I can reach: they are the gods that must ride on winged horses. A lawyer’s mule of a slow pace will both suit my disposition and business; for, mark me, when a man’s mind rides faster than hishorse can gallop, they quickly both tire. Ant.

Some would think the souls of princes were brought forth by some more weighty cause than those of meaner persons: they are deceiv’d, there’s the same hand to them; the like passions sway them; the same reason that makes a vicar go to law for a tithe-pig, and undo his neighbours, makes them spoil a whole province, and batter down goodly cities with the cannon.

And it was only to know what strange instrument it was should swell up a glass to the fashion of a woman’s belly. Old Lady. I will hear no more of the glass-house. You are still’ abusing women! Bos. Who, I? No; only, by the way now and then, mention your frailties. The orange-tree bears ripe and green fruit and blossoms all together; and some of you give entertainment for pure love, but more for more precious reward. The lusty spring smells well; but drooping autumn tastes well.

Those giddy and wild turnings in yourself. Julia. Did you e’er find them? Card. Sooth, generally for women, A man might strive to make glass malleable, Ere he should make them fixed. Julia.

Ferd. Lower! Rogues do not whisper ’t now, but seek to publish ’t (As servants do the bounty of their lords) Aloud; and with a covetous searching eye, To mark who note them. O, confusion seize her! She hath had most cunning bawds to serve her turn, And more secure conveyances for lust Than towns of garrison for service. Card. Is ’t possible? Can this be certain? Ferd. Rhubarb, O, for rhubarb To purge this choler! Here’s the curséd day To prompt my memory; and here ’t shall stick Till of her bleeding heart I make a sponge To wipe it out. Card. Why do you make yourself So wild a tempest? Ferd. Would I could be one, That I might toss her palace bout her ears, Root up her goodly forests, blast her meads, And lay her general territory as waste As she hath done her honours. Card. Shall our blood, The royal blood of Arragon and Castile, Be thus attainted? Ferd. Apply desperate physic: We must not now use balsamum, but fire, The smarting cupping-glass, for that’s the mean To purge infected blood, such blood as hers. There is a kind of pity in mine eye— Pll give it to my handkercher; and now ’tis here, I'll bequeath this to her bastard. 2 Unchaste.

788 JOHN WEBSTER Card. What to do? Ferd. Why, to make soft lint for his mother’s wounds, When I have hew’d her to pieces. Card. Curs’d creature! Unequal nature, to place women’s hearts So far upon the left side! ® Ferd. Foolish men, That e’er will trust their honour in a bark Made of so slight weak bulrush as is woman, Apt every minute to sink it! Card. Thus ignorance, when it hath purchas’d honour, It cannot wield it. Ferd. Methinks I see her laughing,— Excellent hyena! Talk to me somewhat quickly, Or my imagination will carry me To see her in the shameful act of sin. Card. With whom? Ferd. Happily with some strong-thigh’d bargeman, Or one o’ th’ wood-yard that can quoit the sledge* Or toss the bar, or else some lovely squire That carries coals up to her privy lodgings. Card. You fly beyond your reason. Ferd. Go to, mistress! | "Tis not your whore’s milk that shall quench my wild-fire, But your whore’s blood. Card. How idly shows this rage, which carries you, As men convey’d by witches through the air, On violent whirlwinds! This intemperate noise Fitly resembles deaf men’s shrill discourse, Who talk aloud, thinking all other men To have their imperfection. Ferd. Have not you My palsy? Card. Yes, [but] I can be angry Without this rupture. There is not in nature A thing that makes man so deform’d, so beastly, 3 Supposed to be a sign of folly. 4 Throw the hammer.

THE DUCHESS OF MALFI 789 As doth intemperate anger. Chide yourself. You have divers men who never yet express’d Their strong desire of rest but by unrest, By vexing of themselves. Come, put yourself In tune. Ferd. So I will only study to seem The thing I am not. I could kill her now, In you, or in myself; for I do think It is some sin in us heaven doth revenge By her. Card. Are you stark mad? Ferd. I would have their bodies Burnt in a coal-pit with the ventage stopp’d, That their curs’d smoke might not ascend to heaven; Or dip the sheets they lie in in pitch or sulphur, Wrap them in ’t, and then light them like a match; Or else to-boil® their bastard to a cullis, And give ’t his lecherous father to renew The sin of his back. Card. I'll leave you. Ferd. Nay, I have done. I am confident, had I been damn’d in hell, And should have heard of this, it would have put me Into a cold sweat. In, in; I’ll go sleep. Till I know who [loves] my sister, I'll not stir: That known, I'll find scorpions to string my whips, And fix her in a general eclipse. Exeunt. ACT III Scene I. [Malfi. An apartment in the palace of the Duchess] [Enter] Antonio and Detto Ant. Our noble friend, my most beloved Delio! O, you have been a stranger long at court: Came you along with the Lord Ferdinand? 5 Boil to shreds. (Dyce.) Quartos, to boil.

790 JOHN WEBSTER Delio. 1 did, sir: and how fares your noble duchess? Ant. Right fortunately well: she’s an excellent Feeder of pedigrees; since you last saw her, She hath had two children more, a son and daughter. Delio. Methinks ’twas yesterday. Let me but wink, And not behold your face, which to mine eye Is somewhat leaner, verily I should dream It were within this half hour. Ant. You have not been in law, friend Delio, Nor in prison, nor a suitor at the court, Nor begg’d the reversion of some great man’s place, Nor troubled with an old wife, which doth make Your time so insensibly hasten. Delhio. Pray, sir, tell me, Hath not this news arriv’d yet to the ear Of the lord cardinal? Ant. I fear it hath: The Lord Ferdinand, that’s newly come to court, Doth bear himself right dangerously. Delio. Pray, why? Ant. He is so quiet that he seems to sleep The tempest out, as dormice do in winter. Those houses that are haunted are most still Till the devil be up. Delio. What say the common people? Ant. The common rabble do directly say She is a strumpet. Delio. And your graver heads Which would be politic, what censure they? Ant. They do observe I grow to infinite purchase,’ The left hand way; and all suppose the duchess Would amend it, if she could; for, say they, Great princes, though they grudge their officers Should have such large and unconfined means To get wealth under them, will not complain, Lest thereby they should make them odious Unto the people. For other obligation 1 Wealth.

THE DUCHESS OF MALFI 791 Of love or marriage between her and me They never dream of. Delio. The Lord Ferdinand Is going to bed. [Enter Ducuess, Ferpinanp, and Attendants] Ferd. [ll instantly to bed, For I am weary.—I am to bespeak A husband for you. Duch. For me, sir! Pray, who is ’t? Ferd. The great Count Malatesti. Duch. Fie upon him! A count! He’s a mere stick of sugar-candy; You may look quite through him. When I choose A husband, I will marry for your honour. Ferd. You shall do well in ’t—How is ’t, worthy Antonio? Duch, But, sir, 1 am to have private conference with you About a scandalous report is spread Touching mine honour. Ferd. Let me be ever deaf to ’t: One of Pasquil’s paper-bullets,’ court-calumny, A pestilent air, which princes’ palaces Are seldom purg’d of. Yet, say that it were true, I pour it in your bosom, my fix’d love Would strongly excuse, extenuate, nay, deny Faults, were they apparent in you. Go, be safe In your own innocency. Duch.

Yes, if we could find spectacles to read them. I do suspect there hath been some sorcery Us’d on the duchess. Ferd. Sorcery! to what purpose? Bos. To make her dote on some desertless fellow She shames to acknowledge. Ferd. Can your faith give way To think there’s power in potions or in charms, To make us love whether we will or no? Bos. Most certainly. Ferd. Away! these are mere gulleries,’ horrid things, Invented by some cheating mountebanks To abuse us. Do you think that herbs or charms Can force the will? Some trials have been made In this foolish practice, but the ingredients Were lenitive® poisons, such as are of force To make the patient mad; and straight the witch Swears by equivocation they are in love. The witch-craft lies in her rank blood. This night I will force confession from her. You told me You had got, within these two days, a false key Into her bed-chamber. Bos. I have. Ferd. As I would wish. Bos. What do you intend to do? j Ferd. Can you guess? i Bos. No. Ferd.

Cari. This is a vain poetry: but I pray you, tell me, If there were propos’d me, wisdom, riches, and beauty, In three several young men, which should I choose? Ant.’ Tis a hard question. This was Paris’ case, And he was blind in ’t, and there was a great cause; For how was ’t possible he could judge right, Having three amorous goddesses in view, And they stark naked? *T'was a motion Were able to benight the apprehension Of the severest counsellor of Europe. Now I look on both your faces so well form’d, It puts me in mind of a question I would ask. Cari. What is ’t? Ant. I do wonder why hard-favour’d ladies, For the most part, keep worse-favour’d waiting-women To attend them, and cannot endure fair ones. Duch. O, that’s soon answer’d.

What hideous thing Is it that doth eclipse thee? Duch. Pray, sir, hear me. Ferd. Or is it true thou art but a bare name, And no essential thing? Duch. Sir-—— 3 Ferd. Do not speak. Duch. No, sir: I will plant my soul in mine ears, to hear you. Ferd. O most imperfect light of human reason, 2 Powder of orris-root.

Duch, I pray, sir, hear me: I am married. Ferd. So! Duch. Happily, not to your liking: but for that, Alas, your shears do come untimely now To clip the bird’s wings that’s already flown! Will you see my husband? Ferd. Yes, if I could change Eyes with a basilisk. Duch. Sure, you came hither By his confederacy. Ferd. The howling of a wolf Is music to thee, screech-owl: prithee, peace.— Whate’er thou art that hast enjoy’d my sister, For I am sure thou hear’st me, for thine own sake Let me not know thee. I came hither prepar’d To work thy discovery; yet am now persuaded It would beget such violent effects As would damn us both. I would not for ten millions I had beheld thee: therefore use all means I never may have knowledge of thy name; Enjoy thy lust still, and a wretched life, On that condition—And for thee, vile woman, If thou do wish thy lecher may grow old In thy embracements, I would have thee build Such a room for him as our anchorites To holier use inhabit. Let not the sun Shine on him till he’s dead; let dogs and monkeys Only converse with him, and such dumb things To whom nature denies use to sound his name; Do not keep a paraquito, lest she learn it; If thou do love him, cut out thine own tongue, Lest it bewray him.

THE DUCHESS OF MALFI 797 Duch. Why might not I marry? I have not gone about in this to create Any new world or custom. Ferd. Thou art undone; And thou hast ta’en that massy sheet of lead That hid thy husband’s bones, and folded it About my heart. Duch. Mine bleeds for’t. Ferd. Thine! thy heart! What should I name ’t unless a hollow bullet Fill’d with unquenchable wild-fire? Duch. You are in this Too strict; and were you not my princely brother, I would say, too wilful: my reputation Is safe. Ferd. Dost thou know what reputation is? I'll tell thee,—to small purpose, since the instruction Comes now too late. Upon a time Reputation, Love, and Death, Would travel o’er the world; and it was concluded That they should part, and take three several ways. Death told them, they should find him in great battles, Or cities plagu’d with plagues: Love gives them counsel. To inquire for him ’mongst unambitious shepherds, Where dowries were not talk’d of, and sometimes "Mongst quiet kindred that had nothing left By their dead parents: ‘Stay,’ quoth Reputation, ‘Do not forsake me; for it is my nature, If once I part from any man I meet, I am never found again.’ And so for you: You have shook hands with Reputation, And made him invisible. So, fare you well: I will never see you more. Duch. Why should only I, Of all the other princes of the world, Be cas’d up, like a holy relic? I have youth

798 JOHN WEBSTER And a little beauty. Ferd. So you have some virgins ‘That are witches. I will never see thee more. Exit. Re-enter ANTONIO with a pistol, |and Caxtota] Duch. You saw this apparition?

That gallery gave him entrance. Ant. I would this terrible thing would come again, That, standing on my guard, I might relate My warrantable love.— She shows the poniard. Ha! what means this? Duch. He left this with me. Ant. And it seems did wish You would use it on yourself. Duch. His action seem’d To intend so much. Ant. This hath a handle to’t, As well as a point: turn it towards him, and So fasten the keen edge in his rank gall. [| Knocking within.]| How now! who knocks? More earthquakes? Duch. I stand As if a mine beneath my feet were ready To be blown up. Cart. Tis Bosola. Duch. Away! O misery! methinks unjust actions Should wear these masks and curtains, and not we.

The place that you must fly to is Ancona: Hire a house there; I'll send after you My treasure and my jewels. Our weak safety Runs upon enginous wheels:* short syllables Must stand for periods. I must now accuse you Of such a feigned crime as Tasso calls Magnanima menzogna, a noble lie, Cause it must shield our honours.—Hark! they are coming. [Re-enter Bosota and Officers | Ant. Will your grace hear me? Duch. I have got well by you; you have yielded me A million of loss: I am like to inherit The people’s curses for your stewardship. You had the trick in audit-time to be sick, 3 Wheels of craft. i

800 JOHN WEBSTER Till I had sign’d your quietus;* and that cur’d you Without help of a doctor —Gentlemen, I would have this man be an example to you all; So shall you hold my favour; I pray, let him; For h’as done that, alas, you would not think of, And, because I intend to be rid of him, I mean not to publish.—Use your fortune elsewhere. Ant. I am strongly arm’d to brook my overthrow, As commonly men bear with a hard year. I will not blame the cause on ’t; but do think The necessity of my malevolent star Procures this, not her humour. O, the inconstant And rotten ground of service! You may see, Tis even like him, that in a winter night, Takes a long slumber o’er a dying fire, A-loth to part from ’t; yet parts thence as cold As when he first sat down. Duch. We do confiscate, Towards the satisfying of your accounts, All that you have. Ant. I am all yours; and ’tis very fit All mine should be so. Duch. So, sir, you have your pass. Ant. You may see, gentlemen, what ’tis to serve A prince with body and soul. Exit. Bos. Here’s an example for extortion: what moisture is drawn out of the sea, when foul weather comes, pours down, and runs into the sea again. ) Duch.1 would know what are your opinions Of this Antonio. Sec. Off. He could not abide to see a pig’s head gaping : I thought your grace would find him a Jew. Third Off. I would you had been his officer, for your own sake. Fourth Off. You would have had more money. First Off. He stopped his ears with black wool, and to those came to him for money said he was thick of hearing. 4Certificate that the books were found correct.

THE DUCHESS OF MALFI Sor Sec. Off. Some said he was an hermaphrodite, for he could not abide a woman. Fourth Off. How scurvy proud he would look when the treasury was full! Well, let him go. First Off. Yes, and the chippings of the buttery fly after him, to scour his gold chain.’ Duch. Leave us. Exeunt | Officers. | What do you think of these? Bos. That these are rogues that in ’s prosperity, But to have waited on his fortune, could have wish’d His dirty stirrup riveted through their noses, And follow’d after ’s mule, like a bear in a ring; Would have prostituted their daughters to his lust; Made their first-born intelligencers;° thought none happy But such as were born under his blest planet, And wore his livery: and do these lice drop off now? Well, never look to have the like again: He hath left a sort’ of flattering rogues behind him; Their doom must follow. Princes pay flatterers In their own money: flatterers dissemble their vices, And they dissemble their lies; that’s justice. Alas, poor gentleman! Duch. Poor! he hath amply fill’d his coffers. Bos. Sure, he was too honest. Pluto,’ the god of riches, When he’s sent by Jupiter to any man, He goes limping, to signify that wealth That comes on God’s name comes slowly; but when he’s sent On the devil’s errand, he rides post and comes in by scuttles.° Let me show you what a most unvalu’d jewel You have in a wanton humour thrown away, To bless the man shall find him. He was an excellent Courtier and most faithful; a soldier that thought it As beastly to know his own value too little As devilish to acknowledge it too much. Both his virtue and form deserv’d a far better fortune: 5The badge of a steward. Spies. 7 Lot. 8For Plutus. Quick steps.

802 JOHN WEBSTER His discourse rather delighted to judge itself than show itself: His breast was fill’d with all perfection, And yet it seemed a private whisp’ring-room, It made so little noise of ’t. Duch. But he was basely descended. Bos. Will you make yourself a mercenary herald, Rather to examine men’s pedigrees than virtues? You shall want’® him: For know an honest statesman to a prince Is like a cedar planted by a spring; The spring bathes the tree’s root, the grateful tree Rewards it with his shadow: you have not done so. I would sooner swim to the Bermoothes on Two politicians’ rotten bladders, tied Together with an intelligencer’s heart-string, Than depend on so changeable a prince’s favour. Fare thee well, Antonio! Since the malice of the world Would needs down with thee, it cannot be said yet That any ill happen’d unto thee, considering thy fall Was accompanied with virtue. Duch. O, you render me excellent music! Bos. Say you? Duch. This good one that you speak of is my husband. Bos. Do I not dream? Can this ambitious age Have so much goodness in ’t as to prefer A man merely for worth, without these shadows Of wealth and painted honours? Possible? Duch. have had three children by him. Bos. Fortunate lady! For you have made your private nuptial bed | The humble and fair seminary of peace, No question but: many an unbenefic’d scholar Shall pray for you for this deed, and rejoice That some preferment in the world can yet Arise from merit. The virgins of your land That have no dowries shall hope your example 10 Miss.

THE DUCHESS OF MALFI Will raise them to rich husbands. Should you want Soldiers, *twould make the very Turks and Moors Turn Christians, and serve you for this act. Last, the neglected poets of your time, In honour of this trophy of a man, Rais’d by that curious engine, your white hand, Shall thank you, in your grave, for ’t; and make that More reverend than all the cabinets Of living princes. For Antonio, His fame shall likewise flow from many a pen, When heralds shall want coats to sell to men. Duch. As I taste comfort in this friendly speech, So would I find concealment. Bos. O, the secret of my prince, Which I will wear on th’ inside of my heart! Duch. You shall take charge of all my coin and jewels, And follow him; for he retires himself To Ancona. Bos. So. Duch. Whither, within few days, I mean to follow thee. Bos. Let me think: I would wish your grace to feign a pilgrimage To our Lady of Loretto, scarce seven leagues From fair Ancona; so may you depart Your country with more honour, and your flight Will seem a princely progress, retaining Your usual train about you. Duch. Sir, your direction Shall lead me by the hand. Cart. In my opinion, She were better progress to the baths at Lucca, Or go visit the Spa In Germany; for, if you will believe me, I do not like this jesting with religion, This feigned pilgrimage. Duch. Thou art a superstitious fool: 803

Delio.1 think he would run away from a battle, To save it from taking prisoner. Sil. He is horribly afraid Gun-powder will spoil the perfume on ’t. Delio. 1 saw a Dutchman break his pate once For calling him pot-gun; he made his head Have a bore in ’t like a musket. Sil. 1 would he had made a touch-hole to ’t.

The Cardinal of Arragon Is this day to resign his cardinal’s hat: His sister duchess likewise is arriv’d To pay her vow of pilgrimage. I expect A noble ceremony. First. Pil. No question—They come. [Here the ceremony of the Carvinat’s instalment, in the habit of a soldier, perform’d in delivering up hts cross, hat, robes, and ring, at the shrine, and investing him with sword, helmet, shield, and spurs; then Antonio, the Ducuess and their children, having presented themselves at the shrine, are, by a form of banishment in dumb-show expressed towards them by the Carvinat and the state of Ancona, banished: during all which ceremony, this ditty is sung, to very solemn music, by divers churchmen: and then exeunt [all except the Two Pilgrims]. Arms and honours deck thy story, To thy fame’s eternal glory! Adverse fortune ever fly thee; No disastrous fate come nigh thee!

O worthy of worthiest name, adorn’d in this manner, Lead bravely thy forces on under war’s warlike banner! O, mayst thou prove fortunate in all martial courses! Guide thou still by skill in arts and forces! Victory attend thee nigh, whilst fame sings loud thy powers;

Here’s a strange turn of state! who would have thought So great a lady would have match’d herself Unto so mean a person? Yet the cardinal Bears himself much too cruel. Sec. Pil. They are banish’d. First Pil. But I would ask what power hath this state Of Ancona to determine of a free prince? Sec. Pil. They are a free state, sir, and her brother show’d How that the Pope, fore-hearing of her looseness, Hath seiz’d into th’ protection of the church The dukedom which she held as dowager. First Pil. But by what justice? Sec. Pil. Sure, I think by none, Only her brother’s instigation. First Pil. What was it with such violence he took Off from her finger? Sec. Pil.

THE DUCHESS OF MALFI 809 Ant. These poor men, Which have got little in your service, vow To take your fortune: but your wiser buntings,’ Now they are fledg’d, are gone. Duch. They have done wisely. This puts me in mind of death: physicians thus, With their hands full of money, use to give o’er Their patients. Ant. Right the fashion of the world: From decay’d fortunes every flatterer shrinks; Men cease to build where the foundation sinks. Duch.1 had a very strange dream to-night. Ant. What was ’t? Duch. Methought I wore my coronet of state, And on a sudden all the diamonds Were chang’d to pearls. Ant. My interpretation Is, you'll weep shortly; for to me the pearls Do signify your tears. Duch. The birds that live i’ th’ field On the wild benefit of nature live Happier than we; for they may choose their mates, And carol their sweet pleasures to the spring. [ Enter Bosora with a letter | Bos. You are happily o’erta’en. Duch. From my brother? Bos. Yes, from the Lord Ferdinand your brother All love and safety. Duch.

810 JOHN WEBSTER That is, he cannot sleep till you be dead. And here’s another pitfall that’s strew’d o’er With roses; mark it, ’tis a cunning one: [ Reads.| ‘I stand engaged for your husband for several debts at Naples: let not that trouble him; I had rather have his heart than his money :— And I believe so too. Bos. What do you believe? Duch. That he so much distrusts my husband’s love, He will by no means believe his heart is with him Until he see it: the devil is not cunning enough To circumvent us in riddles. Bos. Will you reject that noble and free league Of amity and love which I present you? Duch, Their league is like that of some politic kings, Only to make themselves of strength and power To be our after-ruin; tell them so. Bos. And what from you? Ant. Thus tell him; I will not come. Bos. And what of this? Ant. My brothers have dispers’d Bloodhounds abroad; which till I hear are muzzl’d, No truce, though hatch’d with ne’er such politic skill, Is safe, that hangs upon our enemies’ will. I'll not come at them. Bos. This proclaims your breeding. Every small thing draws a base mind to fear, As the adamant draws iron. Fare you well, sir; You shall shortly hear from ’s. Duch. I suspect some ambush; Therefore by all my love I do conjure you To take your eldest son, and fly towards Milan. Let us not venture all this poor remainder In one unlucky bottom. Ant. You counsel safely. Best of my life, farewell. Since we must part, Heaven hath a hand in ’t; but no otherwise

I know not which is best, To see you dead, or part with you—Farewell, boy: Thou art happy that thou hast not understanding To know thy misery; for all our wit And reading brings us to a truer sense Of sorrow.—In the eternal church, sir, I do hope we shall not part thus. Ant. O, be of comfort! Make patience a noble fortitude, And think not how unkindly we are us’d: Man, like to cassia, is prov’d best, being bruis’d. Duch. Must I, like to slave-born Russian, Account it praise to suffer tyranny? And yet, O heaven, thy heavy hand is in ’t! I have seen my little boy oft scourge his top, And compar’d myself to ’t: naught made me e’er Go right but heaven’s scourge-stick. Ant. Do not weep: Heaven fashion’d us of nothing; and we strive To bring ourselves to nothing.—Farewell, Cariola, And thy sweet armful.—If I do never see thee more, Be a good mother to your little ones, And save them from the tiger: fare you well. Duch, Let me look upon you once more, for that speech Came from a dying father. Your kiss is colder Than that I have seen an holy anchorite Give to a dead man’s skull. Ant.

With such a pity men preserve alive Pheasants and quails, when they are not fat enough To be eaten. Bos. These are your children? Duch. Yes. Bos. Can they prattle? — Duch. No: But I intend, since they were born accurs’d, Curses shall be their first language. Bos. Fie, madam! Forget this base, low fellow—— Duch.

Duch, I prithee, who is greatest? Can you tell? Sad tales befit my woe: I'll tell you one. A salmon, as she swam unto the sea, Met with a dog-fish, who encounters her With this rough language; ‘Why art thou so bold To mix thyself with our high state of floods, Being no eminent courtier, but one That for the calmest and fresh time o’ th’ year Dost live in shallow rivers, rank’st thyself With silly smelts and shrimps? And darest thou Pass by our dog-ship without reverence?’ ‘O, quoth the salmon, ‘sister, be at peace: Thank Jupiter we both have pass’d the net! Our value never can be truly known, Till in the fisher’s basket we be shown: TP th’ market then my price may be the higher, Even when I am nearest to the cook and fire.’ So to great men the moral may be stretched; Men oft are valu’d high, when they’re most wretched.— But come, whither you please. I am arm’d ’gainst misery; Bent to all sways of the oppressor’s will: There’s no deep valley but near some great hill. -Exeunt. ACT IV ScenE I. [Malfi.

Ferd. Her melancholy seems to be fortified With a strange disdain. Bos. Tis so; and this restraint, Like English mastives that grow fierce with tying, Makes her too passionately apprehend Those pleasures she is kept from. Ferd. Curse upon her! I will no longer study in the book Of another’s heart. Inform her what I told you. Exit. [Enter Ducuess and Attendants] Bos. All comfort to your grace! Duch. I will have none. Pray thee, why dost thou wrap thy poison’d pills In gold and sugar? Bos.

816 JOHN WEBSTER Bos. Look you, here’s the piece from which ’twas ta’en. He doth present you this sad spectacle, That, now you know directly they are dead, Hereafter you may wisely cease to grieve For that which cannot be recovered. Duch. There is not between heaven and earth one wish I stay for after this. It wastes me more Than were’t my picture, fashion’d out of wax, Stuck with a magical needle, and then buried In some foul dunghill; and yon’s an excellent property For a tyrant, which I would account mercy. Bos. What’s that? Duch. If they would bind me to that lifeless trunk, And let me freeze to death. Bos. Come, you must live. Duch. That’s the greatest torture souls feel in hell, In hell, that they must live, and cannot die. Portia,’ I’ll new kindle thy coals again, And revive the rare and almost dead example Of a loving wife. Bos. O, fie! despair? Remember You are a Christian. Duch. The church enjoins fasting: I'll starve myself to death. Bos. Leave this vain sorrow.

Good comfortable fellow, Persuade a wretch that’s broke upon the wheel To have all his bones new set; entreat him live To be executed again. Who must despatch me? I account this world a tedious theatre, For I do play a part in’t ’gainst my will. Bos. Come, be of comfort; I will save your life. Duch. Indeed, I have not leisure to tend so small a business. 2 The wife of Brutus, who died by swallowing fire.

Puff, let me blow these vipers from me. [Enter Servant] What are you? Serv. One that wishes you long life. Duch. 1 would thou wert hang’d for the horrible curse Thou hast given me: I shall shortly grow one Of the miracles of pity. I'll go pray;— [Exit Servant. | No, I'll go curse. Bos. O, fie! Duch. I could curse the stars. Bos. O, fearful! Duch. And those three smiling seasons of the year Into a Russian winter; nay, the world To its first chaos. Bos. Look you, the stars shine still. Duch. O, but you must Remember, my curse hath a great way to go.— Plagues, that make lanes through largest families, Consume them!— Bos. Fie, lady! Duch.

To bring her to despair. Bos. Faith, end here, And go no farther in your cruelty: Send her a penitential garment to put on Next to her delicate skin, and furnish her With beads and prayer-books. Ferd. Damn her! that body of hers, While that my blood ran pure in’t, was more worth Than that which thou wouldst comfort, call’d a soul. I will send her masques of common courtezans, Have her meat serv’d up by bawds and rufhians, And, ’cause she'll needs be mad, I am resolv’d To move forth the common hospital All the mad-folk, and place them near her lodging; There let them practise together, sing and dance, And act their gambols to the full o’ th’ moon: If she can sleep the better for it, let her. Your work is almost ended. Bos. Must I see her again? Ferd. Yes. Bos. Never. Ferd, You must. Bos.

Tis the wild consort’ Of madmen, lady, which your tyrant brother Hath plac’d about your lodging. This tyranny, I think, was never practis’d till this hour. Duch. Indeed, I thank him. Nothing but noise and folly Can keep me in my right wits; whereas reason And silence make me stark mad. Sit down; Discourse to me some dismal tragedy. Cari. O, twill increase your melancholy! Duch. Thou art deceiv’d: To hear of greater grief would lessen mine. This is a prison? Cart. Yes, but you shall live To shake this durance off. Duch. Thou art a fool: The robin-red-breast and the nightingale ‘Never live long in cages. Cart. Pray, dry your eyes. ‘What think you of, madam? Duch. Of nothing; ‘When I muse thus, I sleep. Cari.

820 JOHN WEBSTER From them I should learn somewhat, I am sure, I never shall know here. I'll tell thee a miracle: I am not mad yet, to my cause of sorrow: Th’ heaven o’er my head seems made of molten brass, The earth of flaming sulphur, yet I am not mad. I am acquainted with sad misery As the tann’d galley-slave is with his oar; Necessity makes me suffer constantly, And custom makes it easy. Who do I look like now? Cari. Like to your picture in the gallery, A deal of life in show, but none in practice; Or rather like some reverend monument Whose ruins are even pitied. Duch. Very proper; And Fortune seems only to have her eye-sight To behold my tragedy—How now! What noise is that? [Enter Servant | Serv. I am come to tell you Your brother hath intended you some sport.

There’s a mad lawyer; and a secular priest; A doctor that hath forfeited his wits By jealousy; an astrologian That in his works said such a day o’ the month Should be the day of doom, and, failing oft, Ran mad; an English tailor craz’d i’ the brain With the study of new fashions; a gentleman-usher Quite beside himself with care to keep in mind 2Bands. 3 Boil.

Duch. Sit, Cariola—Let them loose when you please, For I am chain’d to endure all your tyranny. [Enter Madman] Here by a Madman this song is sung to a dismal kind of music O, let us howl some heavy note, Some deadly dogged howl, Sounding as from the threatening throat Of beasts and fatal fowl! As ravens, screech-owls, bulls, and bears, We'll bell, and baw! our parts, Till irksome noise have cloy’d your ears And corrosiv’d your hearts. At last, whenas our choir wants breath, Our bodies being blest, We'll sing, like swans, to welcome death, And die in love and rest. First Madman. Doom’s-day not come yet! I'll draw it nearer by a perspective, or make a glass that shall set all the world on fire upon an instant. I cannot sleep; my pillow is stuffed with a litter of /porcupines. Second Madman. Hell is a mere glass-house, where the devils are ‘continually blowing up women’s souls on hollow irons, and the fire ‘Mever goes out. First Madman. I have skill in heraldry. Second Madman. Hast?

Second Madman. No, no, no, a snuffling knave that, while he shows the tombs, will have his hand in a wench’s placket.’ Third Madman. Woe to the caroche’ that brought home my wife from the masque at three o’clock in the morning! It had a large feather-bed in it. Fourth Madman. I have pared the devil’s nails forty times, roasted them in raven’s eggs, and cured agues with them. Third Madman. Get me three hundred milch-bats, to make possets’ to procure sleep. Fourth Madman. All the college may throw their caps at me: I have made a soap-boiler costive; it was my masterpiece.

I ’ll leave you. _[Exeunt Servant and Madmen. } Bos. I am come to make thy tomb. Duch. Ha! my tomb! Thou speak’st as if I lay upon my death-bed, Gasping for breath. Dost thou perceive me sick? | Bos.

Didst thou ever see a lark in a cage? Such is the soul in the body: this world is like her little turf of grass, and the heaven o’er our heads like her looking-glass, only gives us a miserable knowledge of the small compass of our prison. Duch. Am not I thy duchess? Bos. Thou art some great woman, sure, for riot begins to sit on thy forehead (clad in gray hairs) twenty years sooner than on a merry milk-maid’s. Thou sleepest worse than if a mouse should be forced to take up her lodging in a cat’s ear: a little infant that breeds its teeth, should it lie with thee, would cry out, as if thou wert the more unquiet bedfellow. Duch. 1 am Duchess of Malfi still. Bos. ‘That makes thy sleep so broken: Glories, like glow-worms, afar off shine bright, But, look’d to near, have neither heat nor light. Duch. Thou art very plain. Bos. My trade is to flatter the dead, not the living; I am a tombmaker. Duch. And thou comest to make my tomb? Bos. Yes. Duch. Let me be a little merry:—of what stuff wilt thou make it? Bos. Nay, resolve me first, of what fashion? Duch. Why, do we grow fantastical on our deathbed? Do we affect fashion in the grave? Bos. Most ambitiously. Princes’ images on their tombs do not lie, as they were wont, seeming to pray up to heaven; but with their _ hands under their cheeks, as if they died of the tooth-ache. They are not carved with their eyes fix’d upon the stars, but as their minds were wholly bent upon the world, the selfsame way they seem to turn their faces. Duch.

Let me see it: I have so much obedience in my blood, I wish it in their veins to do them good. Bos. This is your last presence-chamber. Cari. O my sweet lady! Duch. Peace; it affrights not me. Bos. I am the common bellman That usually is sent to condemn’d persons The night before they suffer. Duch. Even now thou said’st Thou wast a tomb-maker. Bos. "Twas to bring you By degrees to mortification. Listen. Hark, now everything is still, The screech-owl and the whistler shrill Call upon our dame aloud, And bid her quickly don her shroud! Much you had of land and rent; Your length in clay ’s now competent: A long war disturb’d your mind; Here your perfect peace is sign’d. Of what is’t fools make such vain keeping? Sin their conception, their birth weeping, Their life a general mist of error, Their death a hideous storm of terror. Strew your hair with powders sweet, Don clean linen, bathe your feet, And (the foul fiend more to check) A crucifix let bless your neck. Tis now full tide ’tween night and day; End your groan, and come away. Cari. Hence, villains, tyrants, murderers! Alas! What will you do with my lady?—Call for help! Duch. To whom? To our next neighbours? They are mad/-folks

THE DUCHESS OF MALFI 825 Bos. Remove that noise. Duch. Farewell, Cariola. In my last will I have not much to give: A many hungry guests have fed upon me; Thine will be a poor reversion. Cari.

Who would be afraid on ’t, Knowing to meet such excellent company In th’ other world? Bos. Yet, methinks, The manner of your death should much afflict you: This cord should terrify you. Duch. Not a whit: What would it pleasure me to have my throat cut With diamonds? or to be smothered With cassia? or to be shot to death with pearls? I know death hath ten thousand several doors For men to take their exits; and tis found They go on such strange geometrical hinges, You may open them both ways: any way, for heaven-sake, So I were out of your whispering.

Constantly. Bos. Do you not weep? Other sins only speak; murder shrieks out. The element of water moistens the earth, But blood flies upwards and bedews the heavens. Ferd. Cover her face; mine eyes dazzle: she died young. Bos. 1 think not so; her infelicity Seem’d to have years too many. Ferd. She and I were twins; And should I die this instant, I had liv’d Her time to a minute. Bos.

828 JOHN WEBSTER If thou hadst borne her to some sanctuary! Or, bold in a good cause, oppos’d thyself, With thy advanced sword above thy head, Between her innocence and my revenge! I bade thee, when I was distracted of my wits, Go kill my dearest friend, and thou hast done ’t. For let me but examine well the cause: What was the meanness of her match to me? Only I must confess I had a hope, Had she continu’d widow, to have gain’d An infinite mass of treasure by her death: And that was the main cause,—her marriage, That drew a stream of gall quite through my heart. For thee, as we observe in tragedies That a good actor many times is curs’d For playing a villain’s part, I hate thee for ’t, And, for my sake, say, thou hast done much ill well. Bos. Let me quicken your memory, for I perceive You are falling into ingratitude: I challenge The reward due to my service. Ferd. I'll tell thee What I'll give thee. Bos. Do. Ferd. I'll give thee a pardon For this murder. Bos. Hal! Ferd. Yes, and ’tis The largest bounty I can study to do thee. By what authority didst thou execute This bloody sentence? Bos. By yours. Ferd. Mine! was I her judge? Did any ceremonial form of law Doom her to not-being? Did a complete jury Deliver her conviction up i’ the court? Where shalt thou find this judgment register’d,

THE DUCHESS OF MALFI 829 Unless in hell? See, like a bloody fool, Thou ’st forfeited thy life, and thou shalt die for ’t. Bos. The office of justice is perverted quite When one thief hangs another. Who shall dare To reveal this? Ferd. O, I'll tell thee; The wolf shall find her grave, and scrape it up, Not to devour the corpse, but to discover The horrid murder. Bos. You, not I, shall quake for ’t. Ferd. Leave me. Bos. I will first receive my pension. Ferd. You are a villain. Bos. When your ingratitude Is judge, I am so. Ferd. O horror, That not the fear of him which binds the devils Can prescribe man obedience!— Never look upon me more. Bos. ‘Why, fare thee well. Your brother and yourself are worthy men! You have a pair of hearts are hollow graves, Rotten, and rotting others; and your vengeance, Like two chain’d-bullets, still goes arm in arm: You may be brothers; for treason, like the plague, Doth take much in a blood. I stand like one That long hath ta’en a sweet and golden dream: I am angry with myself, now that I wake. Ferd. Get thee into some unknown part o’ the world, That I may never see thee. Bos. Let me know Wherefore I should be thus neglected. Sir, I serv’d your tyranny, and rather strove To satisfy yourself than all the world: And though I loath’d the evil, yet I lov’d You that did counsel it; and rather sought

830 JOHN WEBSTER To appear a true servant than an honest man. Ferd. Y'll go hunt the badger by owl-light: "Tis a deed of darkness. Exit. Bos. He’s much distracted. Off, my painted honour! While with vain hopes our faculties we tire, We seem to sweat in ice and freeze in fire. What would I do, were this to do again? I would not change my peace of conscience For all the wealth of Europe—She stirs; here’s life:— Return, fair soul, from darkness, and lead mine Out of this sensible hell:—she’s warm, she breathes:— Upon thy pale lips I will melt my heart, To store them with fresh colour——Who’s there? Some cordial drink!—Alas! I dare not call: So pity would destroy pity—Her eye opes, And heaven in it seems to ope, that late was shut, To take me up to mercy. Duch. Antonio! Bos. Yes, madam, he is living; The dead bodies you saw were but feign’d statues. He’s reconcil’d to your brothers; the Pope hath wrought The atonement. Duch. Mercy! Dies. Bos. O, she’s gone again! there the cords of life broke. O sacred innocence, that sweetly sleeps On turtles’ feathers, whilst a guilty conscience Is a black register wherein is writ All our good deeds and bad, a perspective That shows us hell! That we cannot be suffer’d To do good when we have a mind to it! This is manly sorrow; These tears, | am very certain, never grew In my mother’s milk.

Sir, lam Little bound to you. Pes. Why? Delio. Because you deni’d this suit to me, and gave ’t To such a creature.

THE DUCHESS OF MALFI ABS Pes. Do you know what it was? It was Antonio’s land; not forfeited By course of law, but ravish’d from his throat By the cardinal’s entreaty. It were not fit I should bestow so main a piece of wrong Upon my friend; ’tis a gratification Only due to a strumpet, for it is injustice. Shall I sprinkle the pure blood of innocents To make those followers I call my friends Look ruddier upon me? I am glad This land, ta’en from the owner by such wrong, Returns again unto so foul an use As salary for his lust. Learn, good Delio, To ask noble things of me, and you shall find I'll be a noble giver. Delio. You instruct me well. Ant. Why, here’s a man now would fright impudence From sauciest beggars. Pes. Prince Ferdinand’s come to Milan, Sick, as they give out, of an apoplexy; But some say ’tis a frenzy: I am going To visit him. Exit. Ant. "Tis a noble old fellow. Delio. What course do you mean to take, Antonio? Ant. This night I mean to venture all my fortune, Which is no more than a poor ling’ring life, To the cardinal’s worst of malice. I have got Private access to his chamber; and intend To visit him about the mid of night, As once his brother did our noble duchess. It may be that the sudden apprehension Of danger,—for I'll go in mine own shape,— When he shall see it fraight® with love and duty, May draw the poison out of him, and work A friendly reconcilement.

838 JOHN WEBSTER Our sister cannot marry; and I have thought Of an excellent match for her. Do this, and style me Thy advancement. Bos. But by what means shall I find him out? Card. There is a gentleman call’d Delio Here in the camp, that hath been long approv’d His loyal friend. Set eye upon that fellow; Follow him to mass; may be Antonio, Although he do account religion But a school-name, for fashion of the world May accompany him; or else go inquire out Delio’s confessor, and see if you can bribe Him to reveal it. There are a thousand ways A man might find to trace him; as to know What fellows haunt the Jews for taking up Great sums of money, for sure he’s in want; Or else to go to the picture-makers, and learn Who bought’ her picture lately: some of these Happily may take. Bos. Well, I'll not freeze i’ th’ business: I would see that wretched thing, Antonio, Above all sights i’ th’ world. Card. Do, and be happy. Exit. Bos. This fellow doth breed basilisks in ’s eyes, He’s nothing else but murder; yet he seems Not to have notice of the duchess’ death.

Why should I fall in love with such a face else? I have already suffer’d for thee so much pain, The only remedy to do me good Is to kill my longing. Bos. Sure, your pistol holds Nothing but perfumes or kissing-comfits.’ Excellent lady! You have a pretty way on ’t to discover Your longing. Come, come, I'll disarm you, And arm you thus: yet this is wondrous strange. - Julia. Compare thy form and my eyes together, You'll find my love no such great miracle. Now you'll say I am wanton: this nice modesty in ladies Is but a troublesome familiar That haunts them. Bos. Know you me, I am a blunt soldier. Julia. The better: Sure, there wants fire where there are no lively sparks Of roughness. Bos. And I want compliment. | Julia. Why, ignorance In courtship cannot make you do amiss, If you have a heart to do well. Bos. You are very fair. Julia. Nay, if you lay beauty to my charge, I must plead unguilty. Bos.

Bos. | Aside.] I have it, I will work upon this creature.— Let us grow most amorously familiar: If the great cardinal now should see me thus, Would he not count me a villain? Julia. No; he might count me a wanton, Not lay a scruple of offence on you; For if I see and steal a diamond, The fault is not i’ th’ stone, but in me the thief That purloins it. I am sudden with you. We that are great women of pleasure use to cut off These uncertain wishes and unquiet longings, And in an instant join the sweet delight And the pretty excuse together. Had you been i’ th’ street, Under my chamber-window, even there I should have courted you. Bos. O, you are an excellent lady! Julia. Bid me do somewhat for you presently To express I love you. Bos. I will; and if you love me, Fail not to effect it. The cardinal is grown wondrous melancholy; Demand the cause, let him not put you off With feign’d excuse; discover the main ground on’t. Julia. Why would you know this? Bos. I have depended on him, And I hear that he is fall’n in some disgrace With the emperor: if he be, like the mice That forsake falling houses, I would shift To other dependance. Julia. You shall not need Follow the wars: I'll be your maintenance. Bos. And I your loyal servant: but I cannot Leave my calling. Julia. Not leave an ungrateful General for the love of a sweet lady!

[ Exeunt Servants. | Yond’s my lingering consumption: I am weary of her, and by any means Would be quit of. | Julia. How now, my lord! what ails you? Card. Nothing. Julia. O, you are much alter’d: Come, I must be your secretary, and remove This lead from off your bosom: what’s the matter? Card. I may not tell you. Julia. Are you so far in love with sorrow You cannot part with part of it? Or think you I cannot love your grace when you are sad As well as merry? Or do you suspect I, that have been a secret to your heart

842 JOHN WEBSTER These many winters, cannot be the same Unto your tongue? Card. Satisfy thy longing,— The only way to make thee keep my counsel Is, not to tell thee. Julia. Tell your echo this, Or flatterers, that like echoes still report What they hear though most imperfect, and not me; For if that you be true unto yourself, ll know. Card. Will you rack me? Julia, No, judgment shall Draw it from you: it is an equal fault, To tell one’s secrets unto all or none. Card. The first argues folly. Julia. But the last tyranny. Card. Very well: why, imagine I have committed Some secret deed which I desire the world May never hear of. Julia. Therefore may not I know it? You have conceal’d for me as great a sin As adultery. Sir, never was occasion For perfect trial of my constancy Till now: sir, I beseech you—— Card. You'll repent it. Julia. Never. , Card. It hurries thee to ruin: I'll not tell thee. Be well advis’d, and think what danger ’tis To receive a prince’s secrets. They that do, Had need have their breasts hoop’d with adamant To contain them. I pray thee, yet be satisfi’d; Examine thine own frailty; ’tis more easy To tie knots than unloose them. ’Tis a secret That, like a ling’ring poison, may chance lie Spread in thy veins, and kill thee seven year hence. Julia. Now you dally with me. | Card. No more; thou shalt know it.

THE DUCHESS OF MALFI 843 By my appointment the great Duchess of Malfi And two of her young children, four nights since, Were strangl’d. Julia. O heaven! sir, what have you done! Card. How now? How settles this? Think you your bosom Will be a grave dark and obscure enough For such a secret? Julia. You have undone yourself, sir. Card. Why? Julia. It lies not in me to conceal it. Card. No? Come, I will swear you to ’t upon this book. Julia. Most religiously. Card. Kiss it. [She kisses the book.| Now you shall never utter it; thy curiosity Hath undone thee; thou’rt poison’d with that book. Because I knew thou couldst not keep my counsel, I have bound thee to ’t by death. [ Re-enter Bosota | Bos. For pity-sake, hold! Card. Ha, Bosola! Julia. I forgive you This equal piece of justice you have done; For I betray’d your counsel to that fellow. He over-heard it; that was the cause I said It lay not in me to conceal it. Bos. O foolish woman, Couldst not thou have poison’d him? Julia. "Tis weakness, Too much to think what should have been done. I go, I know not whither. [ Dies.] Card. Wherefore com’st thou hither? Bos. That I might find a great man like yourself, Not out of his wits, as the Lord Ferdinand, To remember my service. Card. I'll have thee hew’d in pieces.

844 JOHN WEBSTER Bos. Make not yourself such a promise of that life Which is not yours to dispose of. Card. Who plac’d thee here? Bos. Her lust, as she intended. Card. Very well: Now you know me for your fellow-murderer. Bos. And wherefore should you lay fair marble colours Upon your rotten purposes to me? Unless you imitate some that do plot great treasons, And when they have done, go hide themselves i’ th’ grave Of those were actors in ’t? Card. No more; there is A fortune attends thee. Bos. Shall I go sue to Fortune any longer? ’Tis the fool’s pilgrimage. Card. I have honours in store for thee. Bos. There are a many ways that conduct to seeming Honour, and some of them very dirty ones. Card. Throw to the devil Thy melancholy. The fire burns well; What need we keep a stirring of ’t, and make A greater smother?*® Thou wilt kill Antonio? Bos. Yes. Card. Take up that body. Bos. I think I shall Shortly grow the common bier for church-yards. Card. 1 will allow thee some dozen of attendants To aid thee in the murder. Bos. O, by no means. Physicians that apply horse-leeches to any rank swelling use to cut off their tails, that the blood may run through them the faster: let me have no train when I go to shed blood, less it make me have a greater when I ride to the gallows. Card. Come to me after midnight, to help to remove That body to her own lodging. I'll give out She died o’ th’ plague; ’twill breed the less inquiry After her death. 8 Smoke.

THE DUCHESS OF MALFI 845 Bos. Where’s Castruccio her husband? Card. He’s rode to Naples, to take possession Of Antonio’s citadel. Bos. Believe me, you have done a very happy turn. Card. Fail not to come. There is the master-key Of our lodgings; and by that you may conceive What trust I plant in you. Bos. You shall find me ready. Exit Carpinat. O poor Antonio, though nothing be so needful To thy estate as pity, yet I find Nothing so dangerous! I must look to my footing: In such slippery ice-pavements men had need To be frost-nail’d well, they may break their necks else; The precedent’s here afore me. How this man Bears up in blood! seems fearless! Why, ’tis well; Security some men call the suburbs of hell, Only a dead wall between. Well, good Antonio, I'll seek thee out; and all my care shall be To put thee into safety from the reach Of these most cruel biters that have got Some of thy blood already. It may be, Ill join with thee in a most just revenge. The weakest arm is strong enough that strikes With the sword of justice. Still methinks the duchess Haunts me: there, there!—’Tis nothing but my melancholy. O Penitence, let me truly taste thy cup, | That throws men down only to raise them up! Exit. Scene III.

Echo. Never see her more. Ant. I mark’d not one repetition of the echo But that; and on the sudden a clear light Presented me a face folded in sorrow. Delio. Your fancy merely. Ant.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE Puitip MassincEr was born.at Salisbury in 1584. Though the son of a Member of Parliament, he seems to have inherited no means, for the first notice we have of him after his leaving Oxford in 1606 is a petition addressed to Henslowe by him and two friends for a payment of five pounds on account, to get them out of prison. After Beaumont retired from play-writing, Massinger became Fletcher’s chief partner, and there is evidence that there existed between them a warm friendship. All Massinger’s relations with his fellow authors of which we have record seem to have been pleasant; and the impression of his personality which one derives from his work is that of a dignified, hard-working, and conscientious man. He seems to have been much interested in public affairs, and he at times came into collision with the authorities on account of the introduction into his plays of more or less veiled allusions to political personages and events. He died in 1640. The best known of Massinger’s works is “A New Way to Pay Old Debts,” which was probably acted for the first time in 1625. The popularity of the play is chiefly due to the principal characters, Sir Giles Overreach, a usurer and extortioner, drawn, however, on such magnificent lines as to rise far above the conventional miser of literature. Overreach is presented with great dramatic skill, the situations being chosen and elaborated so as to throw his figure into high relief; and though his villainy reaches the pitch of monstrosity, the illusion of life is preserved. Here, as elsewhere, Massinger’s sympathies are on the side of wholesome morals; and it was probably the powerful didactic tendency of the play and its fine rhetoric which, united with the impressiveness of the main figure, enabled it to hold the stage into the nineteenth century.

Slave, stop! or I shall lose myself. Froth. Very hardly: You cannot out of your way. Tap. But to my story: You were then a lord of acres, the prime gallant, And I your under-butler. Note the change now; You had a merry time of’t; hawks and hounds, With choice of running horses; mistresses Of all sorts and all sizes, yet so hot, As their embraces made your lordship melt; Which your uncle, Sir Giles Overreach, observing, (Resolving not to lose a drop of them,) On foolish mortgages, statutes, and bonds, For a while suppli’d your looseness, and then left you. Well. Some curate hath penn’d this invective, mongrel. And you have studied it. Tap. I have not done yet. Your land gone, and your credit not worth a token You grew a common borrower; no man scap’d Your paper-pellets, ° from the gentleman To the beggars on highways, that sold you switches In your gallantry.

And you shall thank my worship. Well. Thus, you dog-bolt, And thus—— Beats and kicks him. Tap. [to his wife.| Cry out for help! Well. Stir, and thou diest: Your potent prince, the constable, shall not save you. Hear me, ungrateful hell-hound! Did not I Make purses for you? Then you lick’d my boots, And thought your holiday cloak too coarse to clean them. *T was I that, when I heard thee swear if ever Thou couldst arrive at forty pounds thou wouldst Live like an emperor, ’twas I that gave it In ready gold. Deny this, wretch! Tap. I must, sir; For, from the tavern to the taphouse, all, On forfeiture of their licenses, stand bound Ne’er to remember who their best guests were, If they grew poor like you.

Prithee tell me, Has she no suitors? All. Even the best of the shire, Frank, My lord excepted; such as sue and send, And send and sue again, but to no purpose; Their frequent visits have not gain’d her presence. Yet she’s so far from sullenness and pride, That I dare undertake you shall meet from her A liberal entertainment. I can give you A catalogue of her suitors’ names. Well. Forbear it, While I give you good counsel: I am bound to it.

Just as much As my throat is worth, for that would be the price on’t. To have a usurer that starves himself, And wears a cloak of one and twenty years On a suit of fourteen groats, bought of the hangman, To grow rich, and then purchase, is too common; But this Sir Giles feeds high, keeps many servants, Who must at his command do any outrage; Rich in his habit, vast in his expenses; Yet he to admiration’ still increases In wealth and lordships. Ord. He frights men out of their estates, And breaks through all law-nets, made to curb ill men, As they were cobwebs. No man dares reprove him.

Mar. As I know not that! Well. Come, I will tell thee a secret, and so leave thee. I will not give her the advantage, though she be A gallant-minded lady, after we are married, (There being no woman but is sometimes froward,) To hit me in the teeth, and say, she was forc’d To buy my wedding-clothes, and took me on 2 Ambergris, a fashionable perfume. 3 Cultivate.

As I live, sir, I din’d with him, at the great lady’s table, Simple as I stand here; and saw when she kiss’d him, And would, at his request, have kiss’d me too: But I was not so audacious as some youths are, That dare do anything, be it ne’er so absurd, And sad after performance.

But still the retribution will fall short Of your bounties shower’d upon me, Lov. Loving youth, Till what I purpose be put into act, Do not o’erprize it; since you have trusted me

Still great ones, Above my merit. Lov. Such your gratitude calls ’em; Nor am I of that harsh and rugged temper As some great men are tax’d with, who imagine They part from the respect due to their honours If they use not all such as follow ’em, Without distinction of their births, like slaves. I am not so condition’d; I can make A fitting difference between my footboy And a gentleman by want compell’d to serve me. All. *Tis thankfully acknowledg’d; you have been More like a father to me than a master. Pray you, pardon the comparison. Lov.

"Tis a conquest Few lords can boast of when they are tempted—Oh! Lov. Why do you sigh? Can you be doubtful of me? By that fair name I in the wars have purchas’d, And all my actions, hitherto untainted, I will not be more true to mine own honour Than to my Allworth! All. As you are the brave Lord Lovell, Your bare word only given is an assurance Of more validity and weight to me Than all the oaths, bound up with imprecations,

Lov. So young, and jealous! All, Were you to encounter with a single foe, The victory were certain; but to stand The charge of two such potent enemies, At once assaulting you, as wealth and beauty, And those too seconded with power, is odds Too great for Hercules. Love. Speak your doubts and fears, Since you will nourish them, in plainer language, That I may understand them. All. What’s your will, Though I lend arms against myself, (provided They may advantage you,) must be obeyed. My much-lov’d lord, were Margaret only fair, The cannon of her more than earthly form, Though mounted high, commanding all beneath it, And ramm’d with bullets of her sparkling eyes, Of all the bulwarks that defend your senses Could batter none, but that which guards your sight. But when the well-tun’d accents of her tongue Make music to you, and with numerous’ sounds Assault your hearing, (such as if Ulysses, Now liv’d again, howe’er he stood the Syrens, Could not resist,) the combat must grow doubtful Between your reason and rebellious passions. Add this too; when you feel her touch, and breath Like a soft western wind when it glides o’er Arabia, creating gums and spices; And, in the van, the nectar of her lips, Which you must taste, bring the battalia on, Well arm’d, and strongly lin’d’ with her discourse, And knowing manners, to give entertainment ;— 1Rhythmical. 2 Reinforced.

O my good lord! these powerful aids, which would Make a mis-shapen negro beautiful, (Yet are but ornaments to give her lustre, That in herself is all perfection,) must Prevail for her.

Lik’d you my meat so ill, You'll dine no more with me? 11 Fool. 2 Anticipate.

906 PHILIP MASSINGER Greedy. I will, when you please, And it like’* your ladyship. L. All, When you please, Master Greedy; If meat can do it, you shall be satisfied. And now, my lord, pray take into your knowledge This gentleman; howe’er his outside’s coarse. Presents WELLBORN. His inward linings are as fine and fair As any man’s; wonder not I speak at large: And howsoe’er his humour carries him To be thus accoutred, or what taint soever, For his wild life, hath stuck upon his fame, He may, ere long, with boldness, rank himself - With some that have contemn’d him. Sir Giles Overreach, If I am welcome, bid him so. Over. My nephew! He has been too long a stranger. Faith you have, Pray let it be mended. Lovett confers aside with WELLBORN. Mar. Why, sir, what do you mean? This is “rogue Wellborn, monster, prodigy, That should hang or drown himself;” no man of worship, Much less your nephew. Over. Well, sirrah, we shall reckon For this hereafter. | Mar. I'll not lose my jeer, | Though I be beaten dead for’t. , Well. Let my silence plead | In my excuse, my lord, till better leisure Offer itself to hear a full relation Of my poor fortunes. Lov. I would hear, and help ’em. Over. Your dinner waits you. Lov. Pray you lead, we follow. L. All. Nay, you are my guest; come, dear Master Wellborn. Exeunt all but Greepy. Greedy. “Dear Master Wellborn!” so she said: Heaven! Heaven! I3Tf it please.

A NEW WAY TO PAY OLD DEBTS If my belly would give me leave, I could ruminate All day on this: I have granted twenty warrants To have him committed, from all prisons in the shire, To Nottingham gaol; and now, “Dear Master Wellborn!” And, “My good nephew!”—but I play the fool To stand here prating, and forget my dinner. Re-enter MARRALL Are they set, Marrall? Mar. Long since; pray you a word, sir. Greedy. No wording now. Mar. In troth, I must. My master, Knowing you are his good friend, makes bold with you, And does entreat you, more guests being come in Than he expected, especially his nephew, The table being full too, you would excuse him, And sup with him on the cold meat. Greedy. How! no dinner, After all my care? Mar. *Tis but a penance for A meal; besides, you broke your fast. Greedy. That was But a bit to stay my stomach. A man in commission Give place to a tatterdemalion! Mar. No bug” words, sir; Should his worship hear you—— Greedy. Lose my dumpling too, And butter’d toasts, and woodcocks! Mar. Come, have patience. If you will dispense a little with your worship, And sit with the waiting women, you'll have dumpling, Woodcock, and butter’d toasts too. Greedy. This revives me: I will gorge there sufficiently. 907 Mar. This is the way, sir. Exeunt. 14 Terrifying,

908 PHILIP MASSINGER Scene III. [Another room in Overreach’s house] [Enter] Overreacu, as from dinner Over. She’s caught! O women!—she neglects my lord, And all her compliments appli’d to Wellborn! The garments of her widowhood laid by, She now appears as glorious as the spring, Her eyes fix’d on him, in the wine she drinks, He being her pledge, she sends him burning kisses, And sits on thorns, till she be private with him. She leaves my meat to feed upon his looks, And if in our discourse he be but nam’d, From her a deep sigh follows. And why grieve I At this? It makes for me; if she prove his, All that is hers is mine, as I will work him. Enter MarraLu Mar. Sir, the whole board is troubled at your rising. Over. No matter, I'll excuse it. Prithee, Marrall, Watch an occasion to invite my nephew To speak with me in private. Mar. Who! “The rogue The lady scorned to look on”? : Over. You are a wag. Enter Lapy ALLWortH and WELLBORN Mar. See, sir, she’s come, and cannot be without him. L. All. With your favour, sir, after a plenteous dinner, I shall make bold to walk a turn or two, In your rare garden. Over. There’s an arbour too, If your ladyship please to use it. L. All. Come, Master Wellborn. Exeunt Lapy ALLwWortH and WELLBORN. Over. Grosser and grosser!

There needs none, Sir Giles, I may ere long say father, when it pleases My dearest mistress to give warrant to it. Over. She shall seal to it, my lord, and make me happy. Re-enter WELLBORN and Lapy ALLWoRTH Marg. My lady is return’d. L. All. Provide my coach, I'll instantly away. My thanks, Sir Giles, For my entertainment. Over. *Tis your nobleness To think it such. L. All. I must do you a further wrong In taking away your honourable guest. Lov. I wait on you, madam; farewell, good Sir Giles. L. All. Good Mistress Margaret! Nay, come, Master Wellborn, I must not leave you behind; in sooth, I must not. Over. Rob me not, madam, of all joys at once; Let my nephew stay behind. He shall have my coach, And, after some small conference between us, Soon overtake your ladyship. L. All. Stay not long, sir. Lov. This parting kiss: [Kisses Marcaret| you shall every day hear from me, By my faithful page. All. *Tis a service I am proud of. Exeunt Lorp Lovett, Lapy AttwortH, ALLWoRTH, and MarrRALt. Over. Daughter, to your chamber.— Exit MarcareT. —You may wonder, nephew, After so long an enmity between us, I should desire your friendship.

gIoO PHILIP MASSINGER Well. So I do, sir; "Tis strange to me. Over. But [ll make it no wonder; And what is more, unfold my nature to you. We worldly men, when we see friends and kinsmen Past hopes sunk in their fortunes, lend no hand To lift °em up, but rather set our feet Upon their heads, to press ’em to the bottom; As, I must yield," with you I practis’d it: But, now I see you in a way ta rise, I can and will assist you. This rich lady (And I am glad of ’t) is enamour’d of you; "Tis too apparent, nephew. Well. No such thing: Compassion rather, sir. Over. Well, in a word, Because your stay is short, I’ll have you seen No more in this base shape; nor shall she say She married you like a beggar, or in debt. Well. Aside. He'll run into the noose, and save my labour. Over. You have a trunk of rich clothes, not far hence, In pawn; I will redeem ’em; and that no clamour May taint your credit for your petty debts, You shall have a thousand pounds to cut ’em off, And go a free man to the wealthy lady. Well. This done, sir, out of love, and no ends else—— Over. As it is, nephew. Well, Binds me still your servant. Over. No compliments; you are staid for. Ere you have supp’d You shall hear from me. My coach, knaves, for my nephew. To-morrow I will visit you. Well. Here’s an uncle In a man’s extremes! How much they do belie you, That say you are hard-hearted! Over. My deeds, nephew, . Shall speak my love; what men report I weigh not. Exeunt. — 1 Admit. ql

A NEW WAY TO PAY OLD DEBTS git ACT IV Scene I. [4 room in Lady Allworth’s house] [Enter Lorp] Lovett and ALLwortH Lov. *Tis well; give me my cloak; I now discharge you From further service. Mind your own affairs; I hope they will prove successful. All. What is blest With your good wish, my lord, cannot but prosper. Let aftertimes report, and to your honour, How much I stand engag’d, for I want language To speak my debt; yet if a tear or two Of joy, for your much goodness, can supply My tongue’s defects, I could-—— Lov. Nay, do not melt: This ceremonial thanks to me’s superfluous. Over, (within.) Is my lord stirring? Lov. ’Tis he! oh, here’s your letter. Let him in. Enter OverrEAcH, GREEDY, and MArRALL Over. A good day to my lord! Lov. You are an early riser, Sir Giles. Over. And reason, to attend your lordship. Lov. And you, too, Master Greedy, up so soon! Greedy. In troth, my lord, after the sun is up, I cannot sleep, for I have a foolish stomach That croaks for breakfast. With your lordship’s favour, I have a serious question to demand Of my worthy friend Sir Giles. Lov. Pray you use your pleasure, Greedy. How far, Sir Giles, and pray you answer me Upon your credit, hold you it to be From your manor-house, to this of my Lady’s Allworth’s? Over. Why, some four mile.

gi2 PHILIP MASSINGER Greedy. How! four mile, good Sir Giles—— Upon your reputation, think better; For if you do abate but one half-quarter Of five, you do yourself the greatest wrong That can be in the world; for four miles riding Could not have rais’d so huge an appetite As I feel gnawing on me. Mar. Whether you ride, Or go afoot, you are that way still provided, An it please your worship. Over. How now, sirrah? Prating Before my lord! No difference! Go to my nephew, See all his debts discharg’d, and help his worship To fit on his rich suit. ee Mar. [ Aside.] I may fit you too. Toss’d like a dog still! Exit. Lov. I have writ this morning A few lines to my mistress, your fair daughter. Over. ’Twill fire her, for she’s wholly yours already.— Sweet Master Allworth, take my ring; ’twill carry you To her presence, I dare warrant you; and there plead For my good lord, if you shall find occasion. That done, pray ride to Nottingham, get a licence, Still by this token. [ll have it dispatch’d, And suddenly, my lord, that I may say, My honourable, nay, right honourable daughter. Greedy. Take my advice, young gentleman, get your breakfast; *Tis unwholesome to ride fasting. I'll eat with you, And eat to purpose. Over. Some Fury’s in that gut: Hungry again! Did you not devour, this morning, A shield of brawn, and a barrel of Colchester oysters? Greedy. Why, that was, sir, only to scour my stomach, A kind of a preparative. Come, gentleman, I will not have you feed like the hangman of Flushing, Alone, while I am here.

A NEW WAY TO PAY OLD DEBTS O13 Lov. Haste your return. All. I will not fail, my lord. Greedy. Nor I, to line My Christmas coffer. Exeunt Greepy and ALLWORTH. Over. To my wish: we are private. I come not to make offer with my daughter A certain portion,—that were poor and trivial: In one word, I pronounce all that is mine, In lands or leases, ready coin or goods, With her, my lord, comes to you; nor shall you have One motive to induce you to believe I live too long, since every year I'll add Something unto the heap, which shall be yours too. Lov. You are a right kind father. Over. You shall have reason To think me such. How do you like this seat? It is well wooded, and well water’d, the acres Fertile and rich; would it not serve for change, To entertain your friends in a summer progress? What thinks my noble lord? Lov. ’Tis a wholesome air, And well-built pile; and she that’s mistress of it, Worthy the large revénue. Over. She the mistress! It may be so for a time: but let my lord Say only that he likes it, and would have it, I say, ere long ’tis his. Lov. Impossible. Over. You do conclude too fast, not knowing me, Nor the engines’ that I work by. ’Tis not alone The Lady Allworth’s lands, for those once Wellborn’s (As by her dotage on him I know they will be,) Shall soon be mine; but point out any man’s In all the shire, and say they lie convenient And useful for your lordship, and once more 1 Devices.

QI4 PHILIP MASSINGER I say aloud, they are yours. Lov. I dare not own What’s by unjust and cruel means extorted; My fame and credit are more dear to me, Than so to expose them to be censur’d by The public voice. Over. You run, my lord, no hazard. Your reputation shall stand as fair, In all good men’s opinions, as now; Nor can my actions, though condemn’d for ill, Cast any foul aspersion upon yours. For, though I do contemn report myself As a mere sound, I still will be so tender Of what concerns you, in all points of honour, That the immaculate whiteness of your fame, Nor your unquestioned integrity, Shall e’er be sullied with one taint or spot That may take from your innocence and candour. All my ambition is to have my daughter Right honourable, which my lord can make her: And might I live to dance upon my knee A young Lord Lovell, born by her unto you, I write nil ultra’ to my proudest hopes. As for possessions and annual rents, Equivalent to maintain you in the port Your noble birth and present state requires, I do remove that burthen from your shoulders, And take it on mine own: for, though I ruin The country to supply your riotous waste, The scourge of prodigals, want, shall never find you. Lov. Are you not frighted with the imprecations And curses of whole families, made wretched By your sinister practices? Over. Yes, as rocks are, When foamy billows split themselves against Their flinty ribs; or as the moon is mov’d, 2 Stainlessness. 3 Nothing beyond. 2

A NEW WAY TO PAY OLD DEBTS When wolves, with hunger pin’d, howl at her brightness. I am of a solid temper, and, like these, Steer on a constant course. With mine own sword, If called into the field, I can make that right, Which fearful enemies murmur’d at as wrong. Now, for these other piddling complaints Breath’d out in bitterness; as when they call me Extortioner, tyrant, cormorant, or intruder On my poor neighbour’s right, or grand incloser Of what was common, to my private use; Nay, when my ears are pierc’d with widows’ cries, And undone orphans wash with tears my threshold, I only think what ’tis to have my daughter Right honourable; and ’tis a powerful charm Makes me insensible of remorse, or pity, Or the least sting of conscience. Lov. I admire* The toughness of your nature. Over. Tis for you, My lord, and for my daughter, I am marble; Nay more, if you will have my character In little, I enjoy more true delight In my arrival to my wealth these dark And crooked ways, than you shall e’er take pleasure In spending what my industry hath compass’d. My haste commands me hence; in one word, therefore, Is it a match? Lov. I hope, that is past doubt now. Over. Then rest secure; not the hate of all mankind here, Nor fear of what can fall on me hereafter, Shall make me study aught but your advancement One story higher: an earl! if gold can do it. Dispute not my religion, nor my faith; Though I am borne thus headlong by my will, You may make choice of what belief you please, To me they are equal; so, my lord, good morrow. 4 Wonder at. 975 Exit.

916 PHILIP MASSINGER Lov. He’s gone—I wonder how the earth can bear Such a portent! I, that have liv’d a soldier, And stood the enemy’s violent charge undaunted, To hear this blasphemous beast am bath’d all over In a cold sweat: yet, like a mountain, he (Confirm’d in atheistical assertions) Is no more shaken than Olympus’ is When angry Boreas loads his double head With sudden drifts of snow. Enter Lapy ALLwortH, Waiting Woman, and AMBLE L. All. Save you, my lord! Disturb I not your privacy? Lov. No, good madam; For your own sake I am glad you came no sooner, Since this bold bad man, Sir Giles Overreach, Made such a plain discovery of himself, And read this morning such a devilish matins, That I should think it a sin next to his But to repeat it. L. All. I ne’er press’d, my lord, On others’ privacies; yet, against my will, Walking, for health’ sake, in the gallery Adjoining to your lodgings, I was made (So vehement and loud he was) partaker Of his tempting offers. Lov. Please you to command Your servants hence, and I shall gladly hear Your wiser counsel. L. All. *Tis, my lord, a woman’s, But true and hearty;—wait in the next room, But be within call; yet not so near to force me To whisper my intents. Amb. We are taught better By you, good madam. W. Wom. And well know our distance. 5 Apparently a slip for “Parnassus.”

Ri he af A NEW WAY TO PAY OLD DEBTS L. All. Do so, and talk not; ‘twill become your breeding. Or7 Exeunt AMBLE and Woman. Now, my good lord; if I may use my freedom, As to an honour’d friend—— Lov. You lessen else Your favour to me. Lo AN. I dare then say thus: As you are noble (howe’er common men Make sordid wealth the object and sole end Of their industrious aims) ‘twill not agree With those of eminent blood, who are engag’d More to prefer® their honours than to increase The state left to them by their ancestors, To study large additions to their fortunes, And quite neglect their births:—though I must grant, Riches, well got, to be a useful servant, But a bad master. Lov. Madam, ’tis confessed; But what infer you from it? L. All. This, my lord; That as all wrongs, though thrust into one scale, Slide of themselves off when right fills the other And cannot bide the trial; so all wealth, I mean if ill-acquir’d, cemented to honour By virtuous ways achiev’d, and bravely purchas’d, Is but as rubbish pour’d into a river, (Howe’er intended to make good the bank,) Rendering the water, that was pure before, Polluted and unwholesome. I allow The heir of Sir Giles Overreach, Margaret, A maid well qualified and the richest match Our north part can make boast of; yet she cannot, With all that she brings with her, fill their mouths, That never will forget who was her father; Or that my husband Allworth’s lands, and Wellborn’s, (How wrung from both needs now no repetition,) 6 Promote.

918 PHILIP MASSINGER Were real motives that more work’d your lordship To join your families, than her form and virtues: You may conceive the rest. Lov. I do, sweet madam, And long since have consider’d it. I know, The sum of all that makes a just man happy Consists in the well choosing of his wife: And there, well to discharge it, does require Equality of years, of birth, of fortune; For beauty being poor, and not cried up By birth or wealth, can truly mix with neither. And wealth, where there such difference in years, And fair descent, must make the yoke uneasy :— But I come nearer. L. All, Pray you do, my lord. Lov. Were Overreach’s states thrice centupl’d, his daughter Millions of degrees much fairer than she is, Howe’er I might urge precedents to excuse me, I would not so adulterate my blood By marrying Margaret, and so leave my issue Made up of several pieces, one part scarlet, And the other London blue. In my own tomb I will inter my name first. L. All. Aside. 1 am glad to hear this—— Why then, my lord, pretend your marriage to her? Dissimulation but ties false knots On that straight line by which you, hitherto, Have measur’d all your actions. Lov. I make answer, And aptly, with a question. Wherefore have you, That, since your husband’s death, have liv’d a strict And chaste nun’s life, on the sudden given yourself To visits and entertainments? Think you, madam, "Tis not grown public conference?’ Or the favours Which you too prodigally have thrown on Wellborn Being too reserv’d before, incur not censure? 7 Gossip.

A NEW WAY TO PAY OLD DEBTS L. All. 1 am innocent here; and, on my life, I swear My ends are good. Lov. On my soul, so are mine To Margaret; but leave both to the event: And since this friendly privacy does serve But as an offer’d means unto ourselves, To search each other farther, you having shewn Your care of me, I my respect to you, Deny me not, but still in chaste words, madam, An afternoon’s discourse. L. All. So I shall hear you. ScEnE II. [Before Tapwell’s house | [Enter] Tapwe i and Frotu Tap. Undone, undone! this was your counsel, Froth. Froth. Mine! I defy thee. Did not Master Marrall (He has marr’d all, I am sure) strictly command us, On pain of Sir Giles Overreach’ displeasure, To turn the gentleman out of doors? Tap. "Tis true; But now he’s his uncle’s darling, and has got Master Justice Greedy, since he fill’d his belly, At his commandment, to do anything. Woe, woe to us! Froth. He may prove merciful. Tap. Troth, we do not deserve it at his hands. Though he knew all the passages of our house, As the receiving of stolen goods, and bawdry, 919 [ Exeunt.] When he was rogue Wellborn no man would believe him, And then his information could not hurt us; But now he is right worshipful again, Who dares but doubt his testimony? Methinks, I see thee, Froth, already in a cart, For a close’ bawd, thine eyes ev’n pelted out With dirt and rotten eggs; and my hand hissing, 1 Secret.

920 PHILIP MASSINGER If I scape the halter, with the letter R’ Printed upon it. Froth. Would that were the worst! That were but nine days’ wonder: as for credit, We have none to lose, but we shall lose the money He owes us, and his custom; there’s the hell on’t. Tap. He has summon’d all his creditors by the drum, And they swarm about him like so many soldiers On the pay day: and has found out such a NEW way To PAY HIs OLD DEBTS, as ’tis very likely He shall be chronicled for it! Froth. He deserves it More than ten pageants. But are you sure his worship Comes this way, to my lady’s? A cry within: Brave master Wellborn! Tap. Yes:—I hear him. Froth. Be ready with your petition, and present it To his good grace. Enter We .usorn in a rich habit, {followed by Marratt,| GREEDY, Orver, Furnace, and Creditors; Tapwe.u kneeling, delivers his bill of debt. Well. How’s this! petition’d to?*—— But note what miracles the payment of A little trash, and a rich suit of clothes, Can work upon these rascals! I shall be, I think, Prince Wellborn. Mar. When your worship’s married, You may be—I know what I hope to see you. Well. ‘Then look thou for advancement. Mar. To be known Your worship’s bailiff, is the mark I shoot at. Well.

I remember thy wife brought me Last new-year’s tide, a couple of fat turkeys. Tap. And shall do every Christmas, let your worship But stand my friend now. Greedy. How! with Master Wellborn? I can do anything with him on such terms.— See you this honest couple; they are good souls As ever drew out faucet; have they not A pair of honest faces? Well. I o’erheard you, And the bribe he promis’d. You are cozen’d in them; For, of all the scum that grew rich by my riots, This, for a most unthankful knave, and this, For a base bawd and whore, have worst deserv’d me, And therefore speak not for em. By your place You are rather to do me justice. Lend me your ear: —Forget his turkeys, and call in his license, And, at the next fair, I'll give you a yoke of oxen Worth all his poultry. Greedy. I am chang’d on the sudden In my opinion! Come near; nearer, rascal. And, now I view him better, did you e’er see One look so like an archknave? His very countenance, Should an understanding judge but look upon him, Would hang him, though he were innocent. Tap. Froth. Worshipful sir. Greedy. No, though the great Turk came, instead of turkeys, To beg my favour, I am inexorable. Thou hast an ill name: besides thy musty ale, That hath destroy’d many of the king’s liege people, Thou never hadst in thy house, to stay men’s stomachs, A piece of Suffolk cheese or gammon of bacon, Or any esculent, as the learned call it, For their emolument, but sheer drink only.

Q22 PHILIP MASSINGER For which gross fault I here do damn thy license, Forbidding thee ever to tap or draw; For, instantly, I will, in mine own person, Command the constable to pull down thy sign, And do it before I eat. Froth. No mercy? Greedy. Vanish! If I shew any, may my promis’d oxen gore me! Tap. Unthankful knaves are ever so rewarded. Exeunt Greepy, TAPWELL, and Frotu. Well. Speak; what are you? ist Cred. A decay’d vintner, sir, That might have thriv’d, but that your worship broke me With trusting you with muscadine’ and eggs, And five pound suppers, with your after drinkings, When you lodg’d upon the Bankside. Well. I remember. 1st Cred. I have not been hasty, nor e’er laid to arrest you; And therefore, sir-—— Well. Thou art an honest fellow, Pll set thee up again; see his bill paid— What are you? 2nd Cred. A tailor once, but now mere botcher.® I gave you credit for a suit of clothes, Which was all my stock, but you failing in payment, I was remov’d from the shopboard, and confin’d Under a stall. Well. See him paid;—and botch no more. 2nd Cred. 1 ask no interest, sir. Well. Such tailors need not; If their bills are paid in one and twenty year, They are seldom losers——O, I know thy face, [To 3rp Creprror. | Thou wert my surgeon.

Well. Now, Master Marrall, what’s the weighty secret You promis’d to impart? Mar. Sir, time nor place Allow me to relate each circumstance, This only, in a word: I know Sir Giles Will come upon you for security For his thousand pounds, which you must not consent to. As he grows in heat, as I am sure he will, Be you but rough, and say he’s in your debt Ten times the sum, upon sale of your land; I had a hand in’t (I speak it to my shame) When you were defeated’ of it. Well. That’s forgiven. Mar. I shall deserve ’t. Then urge him to produce The deed in which you pass’d it over to him, Which I know he'll have about him, to deliver To the Lord Lovell, with many other writings, And present monies; I’ll instruct you further, As I wait on your worship.

[A room in Overreach’s house] Enter ALLWorTH and MARGARET All. Whether to yield the first praise to my lord’s Unequall’d temperance or your constant sweetness That I yet live, my weak hands fasten’d on Hope’s anchor, spite of all storms of despair, I yet rest doubtful. Marg. Give it to Lord Lovell; For what in him was bounty, in me’s duty. I make but payment of a debt to which My vows, in that high office regist’red, Are faithful witnesses. All. "Tis true, my dearest: Yet, when I call to mind how many fair ones Make wilful shipwreck of their faiths, and oaths To God and man, to fill the arms of greatness, And you rise up [no]" less than a glorious star, To the amazement of the world,—hold out Against the stern authority of a father, And spurn at honour, when it comes to court you; I am so tender of your good, that faintly, With your wrong, I can wish myself that right You yet are pleas’d to do me. Marg. Yet, and ever. To me what’s title, when content is wanting? Or wealth, rak’d up together with much care, And to be kept with more, when the heart pines In being dispossess’d of what it longs for Beyond the Indian mines? or the smooth brow Of a pleas’d sire, that slaves me to his will, And, so his ravenous humour may be feasted 1Inserted by Dodsley.

A NEW WAY TO PAY OLD DEBTS 925 By my obedience, and he see me great, Leaves to my soul nor faculties nor power To make her own election? All. But the dangers That follow the repulse— Marg. To me they are nothing; Let Allworth love, I cannot be unhappy. Suppose the worst, that, in his rage, he kill me, A tear or two, by you dropt on my hearse In sorrow for my fate, will call back life So far as but to say, that I die yours; I then shall rest in peace: or should he prove So cruel, as one death would not suffice His thirst of vengeance, but with ling’ring torments In mind and body I must waste to air, In poverty join’d with banishment; so you share In my afflictions, which I dare not wish you, So high I prize you, I could undergo ’em With such a patience as should look down With scorn on his worst malice. All. Heaven avert Such trials of your true affection to me! Nor will it unto you, that are all mercy, Shew so much rigour: but since we must run Such desperate hazards, let us do our best To steer between them. Marg. Your lord’s ours, and sure; And, though but a young actor, second me In doing to the life what he has plotted, Enter Overreacn [| behind. | The end may yet prove happy. Now, my Allworth— [Seeing her father.| All. To your letter, and put on a seeming anger. Marg. V’ll pay my lord all debts due to his title; And when with terms, not taking from his honour, He does solicit me, I shall gladly hear him.

926 PHILIP MASSINGER But in this peremptory, nay, commanding way, To appoint a meeting, and, without my knowledge, A priest to tie the knot can ne’er be undone Till death unloose it, is a confidence In his lordship will deceive him. All. I hope better, Good lady. Marg. Hope, sir, what you please: for me I must take a safe and secure course; I have A father, and without his full consent, Though all lords of the land kneel’d for my favour, I can grant nothing. Over. I like this obedience: [Comes forward.] But whatsoe’er my lord writes, must and shall be Accepted and embrac’d. Sweet Master Allworth, You shew yourself a true and faithful servant To your good lord; he has a jewel of you. How! frowning, Meg? Are these looks to receive A messenger from my lord? What’s this? Give me it. Marg. A piece of arrogant paper, like th’ inscriptions. Over. Reads. “Fair mistress, from your servant learn all joys That we can hope for, if deferr’d, prove toys;? Therefore this instant, and in private, meet A husband, that will gladly at your feet Lay down his honours, tend’ring them to you With all content, the church being paid her due.” Is this the arrogant piece of paper? Fool! Will you still be one? In the name of madness what Could his good honour write more to content you? Is there aught else to be wish’d, after these two, That are already offer’d; marriage first, And lawful pleasure after: what would you more? Marg. Why, sir, I would be married like your daughter; Not hurried away i’ th’ night I know not whither, Without all ceremony; no friends invited To honour the solemnity. ? Trifles.

A NEW WAY TO PAY OLD DEBTS 927 All. An’t please your honour, For so before to-morrow I must style you, My lord desires this privacy, in respect His honourable kinsmen are afar off, And his desires to have it done brook not So long delay as to expect* their coming; And yet he stands resolv’d, with all due pomp, As running at the ring, plays, masques, and tilting, To have his marriage at court celebrated, When he has brought your honour up to London. Over. He tells you true; ’tis the fashion, on my knowledge: Yet the good lord, to please your peevishness, Must put it off, forsooth! and lose a night, In which perhaps he might get two boys on thee. Tempt me no further, if you do, this goad = [ Points to his sword.]| Shall prick you to him. Marg. I could be contented, Were you but by, to do a father’s part, And give me in the church. Over. So my lord have you, What do I care who gives you? Since my lord Does purpose to be private, I'll not cross him. I know not, Master Allworth, how my lord May be provided, and therefore there’s a purse Of gold, ’twill serve this night’s expense; to-morrow Pll furnish him with any sums. In the mean time, Use my ring to my chaplain; he is benefic’d At my manor of Gotham, and call’d Parson Willdo: *Tis no matter for a licence, I’ll bear him out in’t. Marg. With your favour, sir, what warrant is your ring? He may suppose I got that twenty ways, Without your knowledge; and then to be refus’d Were such a stain upon me!—If you pleas’d, sir, Your presence would do better. Over. Still perverse! I say again, I will not cross my lord; 3 Wait for.

You may, if you please, put out the name of my lord, In respect he comes disguis’d, and only write, “Marry her to this gentleman.” Over. Well advis’d. "Tis done; away;—Marcaret kneels. My blessing, girl? Thou hast it. Nay, no reply, be gone-——Good Master Allworth, This shall be the best night’s work you ever made. All. I hope so, sir. Exeunt ALLWorTH and MarcareT. Over. Farewell!—Now all’s cocksure: Methinks I hear already knights and ladies Say, Sir Giles Overreach, how is it with Your honourable daughter? Has her honour Slept well to-night? or, will her honour please To accept this monkey, dog, or paraquit,’ (This is state in ladies), or my eldest son To be her page, and wait upon her trencher? My ends, my ends are compass’d—then for Wellborn And the lands; were he once married to the widow—— I have him here—I can scarce contain myself, I am so full of joy, nay, joy all over. Exit. ACL V Scene I. [A room in Lady Allworth’s house] [Enter Lorp] Lovett, Lapy Attwortu, and AMBLE L. All. By this you know how strong the motives were That did, my lord, induce me to dispense A little, with my gravity, to advance, In personating some few favours to him, The plots and projects of the down-trod Wellborn. Nor shall I e’er repent, although I suffer 4 Anticipate your objections. 5 Parrot.

A NEW WAY TO PAY OLD DEBTS 929 In some few men’s opinions for’t, the action; For he that ventur’d all for my dear husband Might justly claim an obligation from me To pay him such a courtesy; which had I Coyly or over-curiously’ denied, | It might have argu’d me of little love To the deceased. Lov. What you intended, madam, For the poor gentleman hath found good success; For, as I understand, his debts are paid, And he once more furnish’d for fair employment: But all the arts that I have us’d to raise The fortunes of your joy and mine, young Allworth, Stand yet in supposition, though I hope well; For the young lovers are in wit more pregnant Than their years can promise; and for their desires, On my knowledge, they are equal. L. All. As my wishes Are with yours, my lord; yet give me leave to fear The building, though well grounded: to deceive Sir Giles, that’s both a lion and a fox In his proceedings, were a work beyond The strongest undertakers; not the trial Of two weak innocents. Lov. Despair not, madam: Hard things are compass’d oft by easy means; And judgment, being a gift deriv’d from Heaven, Though sometimes lodg’d i’ the hearts of worldly men, That ne’er consider from whom they receive it, Forsakes such as abuse the giver of it. Which is the reason that the politic And cunning statesman, that believes he fathoms The counsels of all kingdoms on the earth, Is by simplicity oft over-reach’d. L. All. May he be so! Yet, in his name to express it, Is a good omen. 1 Fastidiously.

930 PHILIP MASSINGER Lov. May it to myself Prove so, good lady, in my suit to you! What think you of the motion? L. All. Troth, my lord, My own unworthiness may answer for me; For had you, when that I was in my prime, My virgin flower uncropp’d, presented me With this great favour; looking on my lowness Not in a glass of self-love, but of truth, I could not but have thought it as a blessing Far, far beyond my merit. Lov. You are too modest, And undervalue that which is above My title, or whatever I call mine. I grant, were I a Spaniard, to marry A widow might disparage me; but being A true-born Englishman, I cannot find How it can taint my honour: nay, what’s more, That which you think a blemish is to me The fairest lustre. You already, madam, Have given sure proofs how dearly you can cherish A husband that deserves you; which confirms me, That, if Iam not wanting in my care To do you service, you'll be still the same That you were to your Allworth: in a word, Our years, our states, our births are not unequal, You being descended nobly, and alli’d so; If then you may be won to make me happy, But join your lips to mine, and that shall be A solemn contract. L. All. I were blind to my own good, Should I refuse it; [Kisses him] yet, my lord, receive me As such a one, the study of whose whole life Shall know no other object but to please you. Lov. If I return not, with all tenderness, Equal respect to you, may I die wretched! L. All. There needs no protestation, my lord, To her that cannot doubt.—

You could not make choice of a better shape To dress your mind in. L. All. For me, I am happy That my endeavours prosper’d. Saw you of late Sir Giles, your uncle? Well. I heard of him, madam, By his minister, Marrall; he’s grown into strange passions About his daughter.

Look to the writing; Let but the seal be broke upon the box That hast slept in my cabinet these three years, Pll rack thy soul for’t. Mar. Aside. I may yet cry quittance, Though now I suffer, and dare not resist. Over. Lady, by your leave, did you see my daughter lady? And the lord her husband? Are they in your house? If they are, discover, that I may bid ’em joy; And, as an entrance to her place of honour, See your ladyship be on her left hand, and make courtsies When she nods on you; which you must receive As a special favour. L. All. When I know, Sir Giles, Her state requires such ceremony, I shall pay it; But in the meantime, as I am myself, I give you to understand, I neither know Nor care where her honour is. Over. When you once see her Supported, and led by the lord her husband, You'll be taught better——Nephew. Well. Sir. Over. No more? Well. Tis all I owe you. Over.

Well. Well, sir, and what follows? Over. Marry, this; since you are peremptory. Remember, Upon mere hope of your great match, I lent you A thousand pounds: put me in good security, And suddenly, by mortgage or by statute, Of some of your new possessions, or I’ll have you Dragg’d in your lavender robes* to the gaol. You know me, And therefore do not trifle. Well. Can you be So cruel to your nephew, now he’s in The way to rise? Was this the courtesy You did me “in pure love, and no ends else”? Over. End me no ends! Engage the whole estate, And force your spouse to sign it, you shall have Three or four thousand more, to roar and swagger And revel in bawdy taverns. Well. And beg after; Mean you not so? Over. My thoughts are mine, and free. Shall I have security? Well.
