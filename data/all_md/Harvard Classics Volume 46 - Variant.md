EDWARD THE SECOND BY CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE

INTRODUCTORY NOTE A sxetcu of the life and work of Christopher Marlowe will be found prefixed to his play of “Doctor Faustus” in the volume of the Harvard Classics containing Goethe’s “Faust.” The precise date of “Edward II” has not been determined, but it is generally and plausibly assigned to 1590-91. The historical basis for the plot Marlowe found in the Chronicles of Fabyan, Stow, and Holinshed, especially the last. In its treatment of the facts of history, this play is a typical example of the class of drama known as the “chronicle history,” which flourished in the last two decades of the sixteenth century, and culminated in Shakespeare’s “Henry IV” and “Henry V.” While the order of events in history determines for the most part the succession of scenes, the author condenses, omits, elaborates, and re-arranges in order to gain dramatic effectiveness, and to bring out the character of Edward and the results of his weakness. Thus the action covers a historical period of some twenty-two years, though no such stretch of time is suggested by the play; the military operations in Ireland and Scotland, and especially the battle of Bannockburn, are antedated in order to connect them with Gaveston, who was, in fact, dead before any of them occurred; and the adherence of Spencer to the king is made to follow immediately, instead of several years, after the death of the earlier favorite. Yet, with all this freedom in the handling of details, Marlowe succeeds in giving a substantially true, as well as a powerfully affecting, picture of the character and fate of Edward II. The play is the ripest and most masterly of Marlowe’s productions, showing in the delineation of character, the construction of the plot and the freedom and variety of the verse, a striking advance over his earlier work. Nowhere else does he rival so closely his great successor, Shakespeare.

“The reluctant pangs of abdicating Royalty in Edward furnished hints which Shakespeare scarcely improved in his ‘Richard the Second’; and the death-scene of Marlowe’s King moves pity and terror beyond any scene, ancient or modern, with which T am acquainted.” Cuarves Lams.

Y FATHER is deceas’d! Come, Gaveston, And share the kingdom with thy dearest friend,” Ah! words that make me surfeit with delight! What greater bliss can hap to Gaveston Than live and be the favourite of a king! Sweet prince, I come; these, these thy amorous lines Might have enforc’d me to have swum from France, And, like Leander, gasp’d upon the sand, So thou would’st smile, and take me in thine arms. The sight of London to my exil’d eyes

8 MARLOWE Is as Elysium to a new-come soul; Not that I love the city, or the men, But that it harbours him I hold so dear— The king, upon whose bosom let me die,’ And with the world be still at enmity. What need the arctic people love starlight, To whom the sun shines both by day and night? Farewell base stooping to the lordly peers! My knee shal! bow to none but to the king. As for the multitude, that are but sparks, Rak’d up in embers of their poverty;— Tanti,’ V'll fawn first on the wind That glanceth at my lips, and flieth away. Enter three Poor Men But how now, what are these? Poor Men. Such as desire your worship’s service. Gav. What canst thou do? 1st P. Man. 1 can ride. Gav. But I have no horses—What art thou? 2nd P, Man. A traveller. Gav. Let me see: thou would’st do well To wait at my trencher and tell me lies at dinner time; And as I like your discoursing, I'll have you— And what art thou? 3rd P. Man. A soldier, that hath serv’d against the Scot. Gav. Why, there are hospitals for such as you. T have no war, and therefore, sir, begone. 3rd P. Man. Farewell, and perish by a soldier’s hand, That would’st reward them with an hospital. Gav. Ay, ay, these words of his move me as much As if a goose should play the porcupine, And dart her plumes, thinking to pierce my breast. But yet it is no pain to speak men fair; Yi flatter these, and make them live in hope— [ Aside. ] You know that I came lately out of France, 1 Dyce emends to lie. Die may be used in the sense of “swoon.” 2 So much for them.

EDWARD THE SECOND 9 And yet I have not view’d my lord the king; If I speed well, I'll entertain you all. All. We thank your worship. Gav. | have some business: leave me to myself. All. We will wait here about the court. Exeunt. Gav. Do. These are not men for me: I must have wanton poets, pleasant wits, Musicians, that with touching of a string May draw the pliant king which way I please. Music and poetry is his delight; Therefore I’ll have Italian masks by night, Sweet speeches, comedies, and pleasing shows; And in the day, when he shall walk abroad, Like sylvan nymphs my pages shall be clad; My men, like satyrs grazing on the lawns, Shall with their goat-feet dance an antic hay. Sometime a lovely boy in Dian’s shape, With hair that gilds the water as it glides, Crownets of pearl about his naked arms, And in his sportful hands an olive tree, To hide those parts which men delight to see, Shall bathe him in a spring; and there hard by, One like Actzon peeping through the grove Shall by the angry goddess be transform’d, And running in the likeness of an hart By yelping hounds pull’d down, and seem to die;— Such things as these best please his majesty, My lord—Here comes the king, and the nobles From the parliament. I’ll stand aside. [Retires.] Enter Kinc Epwarp, Lancaster, the Elder Mortimer, Young MorTIMER; EpmMunp, Eart of Kent; Guy, Earu of Warwick, and [ Attendants | K. Edw. Lancaster! Lan. My lord. Gav. That Earl of Lancaster do I abhor. [Asede.] 3 A rural dance.

Io MARLOWE K. Edw. Will you not grant me this?—In spite of them I'll have my will; and these two Mortimers, That cross me thus, shall know I am displeas’d. [ Aside. | E. Mor. If you love us, my lord, hate Gaveston. Gav. That villain Mortimer! I'll be his death. [ Aside. ]} Y. Mor. Mine uncle here, this earl, and I myself Were sworn to your father at his death, That he should ne’er return into the realm; And know, my lord, ere I will break my oath, This sword of mine, that should offend your foes, Shall sleep within the scabbard at thy need, And underneath thy banners march who will, For Mortimer will hang his armour up. Gav. Mort Dieu! [ Aside. | K. Edw. Well, Mortimer, I’ll make thee rue these words. Beseems it thee to contradict thy king? Frown’st thou thereat, aspiring Lancaster? The sword shall plane the furrows of thy brows, And hew these knees that now are grown so stiff. I will have Gaveston; and you shall know What danger ’tis to stand against your king. Gav. Well done, Ned! [Aside.] Lan. My lord, why do you thus incense your peers, That naturally would love and honour you But for that base and obscure Gaveston? Four earldoms have I, besides Lancaster— Derby, Salisbury, Lincoln, Leicester,— These will I sell, to give my soldiers pay, Ere Gaveston shall stay within the realm; Therefore, if he be come, expel him straight. Kent. Barons and earls, your pride hath made me mute; But now I'll speak, and to the proof, I hope. I do remember, in my father’s days, Lord Percy of the north, being highly mov’d, Braved Moubery* in presence of the king; For which, had not his highness lov’d him well, 4 Mowbray, but the Qto. spelling indicates the pronunciation.

EDWARD THE SECOND II He should have lost his head; but with his look The undaunted spirit of Percy was appeas’d, And Moubery and he were reconcil’d: Yet dare you brave the king unto his face?— Brother, revenge it, and let these their heads Preach upon poles, for trespass of their tongues. War. O, our heads! K. Edw. Ay, yours; and therefore I would wish you grant— War. Bridle thy anger, gentle Mortimer. Y. Mor. I cannot, nor I will not; I must speak.— Cousin, our hands I hope shall fence our heads, And strike off his that makes you threaten us. Come, uncle, let us leave the brain-sick king, And henceforth parley with our naked swords. E. Mor. Wiltshire hath men enough to save our heads. War. All Warwickshire will love him for my sake. Lan. And northward Gaveston hath many friends.— Adieu, my lord; and either change your mind, Or look to see the throne, where you should sit, To float in blood; and at thy wanton head, ° The glozing® head of thy base minion thrown. Exeunt [all except Kinc Epwarp, Kent, Gaveston and Attendants] K. Edw. 1 cannot brook these haughty menaces. Am I a king, and must be overrul’d?— Brother, display my ensigns in the field; I'll bandy’ with the barons and the earls, And either die or live with Gaveston. Gav.I can no longer keep me from my lord. —_ [Comes forward.] K. Edw. What, Gaveston! welcome!—Kiss not my hand— Embrace me, Gaveston, as I do thee. Why should’st thou kneel? Know’st thou not who I am? Thy friend, thyself, another Gaveston! Not Hylas was more mourn’d of Hercules, Than thou hast been of me since thy exile. Gav. And since I went from hence, no soul in hell 5 This line and the next are ironical. § Flattering. 7 Contend.

I2 MARLOWE Hath felt more torment than poor Gaveston. K. Edw. 1 know it.—Brother, welcome home my friend. Now let the treacherous Mortimers conspire, And that high-minded Earl of Lancaster: I have my wish, in that I joy thy sight; And sooner shall the sea o’erwhelm my land, Than bear the ship that shall transport thee hence. I here create thee Lord High Chamberlain, Chief Secretary to the state and me, Earl of Cornwall, King and Lord of Man. Gav. My lord, these titles far exceed my worth. Kent. Brother, the least of these may well suffice For one of greater birth than Gaveston. K. Edw. Cease, brother, for I cannot brook these words. Thy worth, sweet friend, is far above my gifts, Therefore, to equal it, receive my heart. If for these dignities thou be envied, I'll give thee more; for, but to honour thee, Is Edward pleas’d with kingly regiment.’ Fear’st? thou thy person? Thou shalt have a guard. Wantest thou gold? Go to my treasury. Wouldst thou be lov’d and fear’d? Receive my seal; Save or condemn, and in our name command Whatso thy mind affects, or fancy likes. Gav. It shall suffice me to enjoy your love, Which whiles I have, I think myself as great As Ceasar riding in the Roman street, With captive kings at his triumphant car. Enter the BisHor of CoveNTRY K. Edw. Whither goes my lord of Coventry so fast? B. of Cov. To celebrate your father’s exequies. But is that wicked Gaveston return’d? K. Edw. Ay, priest, and lives to be reveng’d on thee, That wert the only cause of his exile. Gav. ’Tis true; and but for reverence of these robes, 8Rule. 9% Fear’st for.

EDWARD THE SECOND ' 13 Thou should’st not plod one foot beyond this place. B. of Cov. 1 did no more than I was bound to do; And, Gaveston, unless thou be reclaim’d, As then I did incense the parliament, So will I now, and thou shalt back to France. Gav. Saving your reverence, you must pardon me. K. Edw. Throw off his golden mitre, rend his stole, And in the channel” christen him anew. Kent. Ah, brother, lay not violent hands on him! For he'll complain unto the see of Rome. Gav. Let him complain unto the see of hell; Pll be reveng’d on him for my exile. K. Edw. No, spare his life, but seize upon his goods. Be thou lord bishop and receive his rents, And make him serve thee as thy chaplain. I give him thee—here, use him as thou wilt. Gav. He shall to prison, and there die in bolts. K. Edw. Ay, to the Tower, the Fleet, or where thou wilt. B. of Cov. For this offence, be thou accurst of God! K. Edw. Who's there? Convey this priest-to the Tower. B. of Cov. True, true.” K. Edw. But in the meantime, Gaveston, away, And take possession of his house and goods. Come, follow me, and thou shalt have my guard To see it done, and bring thee safe again. Gav. What should a priest do with so fair a house? A prison may best beseem his holiness. [Exeunt. | [Scenz II. The scene is at Westminster] Enter [on one side] both the Mortimers; [on the other,| Warwick and LANCASTER War. ’Tis true, the bishop is in the Tower, And goods and body given to Gaveston. Lan. What! will they tyrannise upon the church? Ah, wicked king! accursed Gaveston! 10Gutter. 47. ¢., You have used the true word ‘Convey’ (=steal).

14 MARLOWE This ground, which is corrupted with their steps, Shall be their timeless’ sepulchre or mine. Y. Mor. Well, let that peevish Frenchman guard him sure; Unless his breast be sword-proof he shall die. E. Mor. How now! why droops the Earl of Lancaster? Y. Mor. Wherefore is Guy of Warwick discontent? Lan. That villain Gaveston is made an earl. E. Mor. An ear!! War. Ay, and besides Lord Chamberlain of the realm, And Secretary too, and Lord of Man. E. Mor. We may not, nor we will not suffer this. Y. Mor. Why post we not from hence to levy men? Lan. “My Lord of Cornwall” now at every word! And happy is the man whom he vouchsafes, For vailing of his bonnet,” one good look. Thus, arm in arm, the king and he doth march: Nay more, the guard upon his lordship waits; And all the court begins to flatter him. War. Thus leaning on the shoulder of the king, He nods and scorns and smiles at those that pass. E. Mor. Doth no man take exceptions at the slave? Lan. All stomach’ him, but none dare speak a word. Y. Mor. Ah, that bewrays their baseness, Lancaster! Were all the earls and barons of my mind, We'll hale him from the bosom of the king, And at the court-gate hang the peasant up, Who, swoln with venom of ambitious pride, Will be the ruin of the realm and us. Enter the { Arcu]pisnor of Canrersury [and an Attendant] War. Here comes my lord of Canterbury’s grace. Lan. His countenance bewrays* he is displeas’d. A. of Cant. First were his sacred garments rent and torn, Then laid they violent hands upon him; next Himself imprisoned, and his goods asseiz’d: This certify the Pope;—away, take horse. {Exit Attendant] 1Untimely. 2? Removing it ay a mark of respect. Feel resentment at. 4 Shows.

EDWARD THE SECOND 15 Lan. My lord, will you take arms against the king? A. of Cant. What need I? God himself is up in arms, When violence is offered to the church. Y. Mor. Then will you join with us, that be his peers, To banish or behead that Gaveston? A. of Cant. What else, my lords? for it concerns me near; The bishopric of Coventry is his. Enter QuEEN [IsaBetza | Y. Mor. Madam, whither walks your majesty so fast? Q. Isab. Unto the forest, gentle Mortimer, To live in grief and baleful discontent; For now, my lord, the king regards me not, But doats upon the love of Gaveston. He claps his cheeks, and hangs about his neck, Smiles in his face, and whispers in his ears; And when I come he frowns, as who should say, “Go whither thou wilt, seeing I have Gaveston.” E. Mor. Is it not strange that he is thus bewitch’d? Y. Mor. Madam, return unto the court again. That sly inveigling Frenchman we'll exile, Or lose our lives; and yet, ere that day come, The king shall lose his crown; for we have power, And courage too, to be reveng’d at full. Q. Isab. But yet lift not your swords against the king. Lan. No; but we will lift Gaveston from hence. War, And war must be the means, or he'll stay still. Q. Isab. Then let him stay; for rather than my lord Shall be oppress’d with civil mutinies, I will endure a melancholy life, And let him frolic with his minion. A. of Cant. My lords, to ease all this, but hear me speak :— We and the rest, that are his counsellors, Will meet, and with a general consent Confirm his banishment with our hands and seals. Lan. What we confirm the king will frustrate. Y. Mor. Then may we lawfully revolt from him.

16 MARLOWE War. But say, my lord, where shall this meeting be? A. of Cant. At the New Temple. Y. Mor. Content. A. of Cant. And, in the meantime, Ill entreat you all To cross to Lambeth, and there stay with me. Lan. Come then, let’s away. Y. Mor. Madam, farewell! Q. Isab. Farewell, sweet Mortimer; and, for my sake, Forbear to levy arms against the king. Y. Mor. Ay, if words will serve; if not, I must. [Scene IIT] Enter Gaveston and Kent Gav. Edmund, the mighty Prince of Lancaster, That hath more earldoms than an ass can bear, And both the Mortimers, two goodly men, With Guy of Warwick, that redoubted knight, Are gone toward Lambeth—there let them remain! [Scene IV] [Exeunt.] Exeunt. Enter [Lancaster, Warwick, Pemsroxe, the Elder Mortimer, Young Mortimer, the ArcuBisHop of CanTersury and Attendants] Lan. Here is the form of Gaveston’s exile: May it please your lordship to subscribe your name. A. of Cant. Give me the paper. [He subscribes, as do the others after him.] Lan. Quick, quick, my lord; I long to write my name. War. But I long more to see him banish’d hence. Y. Mor. The name of Mortimer shall fright the king, Unless he be declin’d from that base peasant. Enter Kinc Epwarp, Gaveston, [and Kent] K. Edw. What, are you mov’d that Gaveston sits here? It is our pleasure; we will have it so.

EDWARD THE SECOND Lan. Your grace doth well to place him by your side, For nowhere else the new earl is so safe. E. Mor. What man of noble birth can brook this sight? Quam male conveniunt! ' See what a scornful look the peasant casts! Pem. Can kingly lions fawn on creeping ants? War. Ignoble vassal, that like Phaeton Aspir’st unto the guidance of the sun! Y. Mor. Their downfall is at hand, their forces down; We will not thus be fac’d and over-peer’d. K. Edw. Lay hands on that traitor Mortimer! E. Mor. Lay hands on that traitor Gaveston! Kent. Is this the duty that you owe your king? War. We know our duties—let him know his peers. K. Edw. Whither will you bear him? Stay, or ye shall die. E. Mor. We are no traitors; therefore threaten not. Gav. No, threaten not, my lord, but pay them home! Were I a king— Y. Mor. Thou villain, wherefore talk’st thou of a king, That hardly art a gentleman by birth? , K. Edw. Were he a peasant, being my minion, I'll make the proudest of you stoop to him. Lan. My lord, you may not thus disparage us.— Away, I say, with hateful Gaveston! E. Mor. And with the Earl of Kent that favours him. 17 [Attendants remove Kent and Gaveston.] K. Edw. Nay, then, lay violent hands upon your king. Here, Mortimer, sit thou in Edward’s throne; Warwick and Lancaster, wear you my crown. Was ever king thus over-rul’d as I? Lan. Learn then to rule us better, and the realm. Y. Mor. What we have done, our heart-blood shall maintain. War. Think you that we can brook this upstart pride? K, Edw. Anger and wrathful fury stops my speech. A. of Cant. Why are you mov’d? Be patient, my lord, And see what we your counsellors have done. 1 How ill they agree!

18 MARLOWE Y. Mor. My lords, now let us all be resolute, And either have our wills, or lose our lives. K. Edw. Meet you for this, proud overbearing peers? Ere my sweet Gaveston shall part from me, This isle shall fleet” upon the ocean, And wander to the unfrequented Inde. A. of Cant. You know that I am legate to the Pope. On your allegiance to the see of Rome, Subscribe, as we have done, to his exile. Y. Mor. Curse him, if he refuse; and then may we Depose him and elect another king. K. Edw. Ay, there it goes! but yet I will not yield. Curse me, depose me, do the worst you can. Lan. Then linger not, my lord, but do it straight. A. of Cant. Remember how the bishop was abus’d! Either banish him that was the cause thereof, Or I will presently discharge these lords Of duty and allegiance due to thee. K. Edw. [Aside.] It boots me not to threat; I must speak fair — The legate of the Pope will be obey’d. My lord, you shall be Chancellor of the realm; Thou, Lancaster, High Admiral of our fleet; Young Mortimer and his uncle shall be earls; And you, Lord Warwick, President of the North; And thou, of Wales. If this content you not, Make several kingdoms of this monarchy, And share it equally amongst you all, So I may have some nook or corner left, To frolic with my dearest Gaveston. A. of Cant. Nothing shall alter us, we are resolv’d. Lan. Come, come, subscribe. Y. Mor. Why should you love him whom the world hates so? K. Edw. Because he loves me more than all the world. Ah, none but rude and savage-minded men Would seek the ruin of my Gaveston; You that be noble-born should pity him. 2 Float.

EDWARD THE SECOND 19 War. You that are princely-born should shake him off. For shame subscribe, and let the lown’ depart. E. Mor. Urge him, my lord. A. of Cant. Are you content to banish him the realm? K. Edw. 1 see I must, and therefore am content. Instead of ink, I'll write it with my tears. [ Subscribes. ] Y. Mor. The king is love-sick for his minion. K. Edw. Tis done; and now, accursed hand, fall off! Lan. Give it me; I’ll have it publish’d in the streets. Y. Mor. I'll see him presently despatch’d away. A. of Cant. Now is my heart at ease. War. And so is mine. Pem. This will be good news to the common sort. E. Mor. Be it or no, he shall not linger here. Exeunt all except Kine Epwarp. K. Edw. How fast they run to banish him I love! They would not stir, were it to do me good. Why should a king be subject to a priest? Proud Rome! that hatchest such imperial grooms, For these thy superstitious taper-lights, , Wherewith thy antichristian churches blaze, I'll fire thy crazed buildings, and enforce The papal towers to kiss the lowly ground! With slaughtered priests make Tiber’s channel swell, And banks rais’d higher with their sepulchres! As for the peers, that back the clergy thus, If I be king, not one of them shall live. Re-enter GAVESTON Gav. My lord, I hear it whispered everywhere, That I am banish’d, and must fly the land. K. Edw. Tis true, sweet Gaveston—O! were it false! The legate of the Pope will have it so, And thou must hence, or I shall be depos’d. But I will reign to be reveng’d of them; And therefore, sweet friend, take it patiently. 3 Fellow.

20 MARLOWE Live where thou wilt, I'll send thee gold enough; And long thou shalt not stay, or if thou dost, T'll come to thee; my love shall ne’er decline. Gav. Is all my hope turn’d to this hell of grief? K. Edw. Rend not my heart with thy too-piercing words: Thou from this land, I from myself am banish’d. Gav. To go from hence grieves not poor Gaveston; But to forsake you, in whose gracious looks The blessedness of Gaveston remains, For nowhere else seeks he felicity. K. Edw. And only this torments my wretched soul That, whether I will or no, thou must depart. Be governor of Ireland in my stead, And there abide till fortune call thee home. Here take my picture, and let me wear thine; [ They exchange pictures.] O, might I keep thee here as I do this, Happy were I! but now most miserable! Gav. ’Tis something to be pitied of a king. K. Edw. Thou shalt not hence—I’ll hide thee, Gaveston. Gav. I shall be found, and then ’twill grieve me more. K. Edw. Kind words and mutual talk makes our grief greater; Therefore, with dumb embracement, let us part— Stay, Gaveston, I cannot leave thee thus. Gav. For every look, my lord* drops down a tear. Seeing I must go, do not renew my sorrow. K. Edw. The time is little that thou hast to stay, And, therefore, give me leave to look my fill. But come, sweet friend, I'll bear thee on thy way. Gav. The peers will frown. K. Edw.1 pass’ not for their anger—Come, let’s go; O that we might as well return as go. Enter Epmunp and QUEEN ISABELLA QO. Isab. Whither goes my lord? K. Edw. Fawn not on me, French strumpet! Get thee gone! 4 Altered to “love’’ in Dodsley, &. 5 Care.

EDWARD THE SECOND 21 Q. Isab. On whom but on my husband should I fawn? Gav. On Mortimer! with whom, ungentle queen— I say no more. Judge you the rest, my lord. Q. Isab. In saying this, thou wrong’st me, Gaveston. Is’t not enough that thou corrupt’st my lord, And art a bawd to his affections, But thou must call mine honour thus in question? Gav. I mean not so; your grace must pardon me. K. Edw. Thou art too familiar with that Mortimer, And by thy means is Gaveston exil’d; But I would wish thee reconcile the lords, Or thou shalt ne’er be reconcil’d to me. Q. Isab. Your highness knows it lies not in my power. K. Edw. Away then! touch me not.—Come, Gaveston. Q. Isab. Villain! ’tis thou that robb’st me of my lord. Gav. Madam, ’tis you that rob me of my lord. K. Edw. Speak not unto her; let her droop and pine. Q. Isab. Wherein, my lord, have I deserv’ qd these words? Witness the tears that Isabella sheds, Witness this heart, that, sighing for thee, aie How dear my lord is to poor Isabel. K, Edw. And witness Heaven how dear thou art to me! There weep; for till my Gaveston be repeal’d, Assure thyself thou com’st not in my sight. Exeunt Epwarp and GavEsToON. Q. Isab, O miserable and distressed queen! Would, when I left sweet France and was embark’d, That charming Circe, walking on the waves, Had chang’d my shape, or at the marriage-day The cup of Hymen had been full of poison, Or with those arms that twin’d about my neck I had been stifled, and not liv’d to see The king my lord thus to abandon me! Like frantic Juno will I fill the earth With ghastly murmur of my sighs and cries; For never doated Jove on Ganymede So much as he on cursed Gaveston.

22 MARLOWE But that will more exasperate his wrath; I must entreat him, I must speak him fair, And be a means to call home Gaveston. And yet he'll ever doat on Gaveston; And so am I for ever miserable. Re-enter Lancaster, Warwick, PEMBROKE, the Elder Mortimer, and Young Mortimer Lan. Look where the sister of the King of France Sits wringing of her hands, and beats her breast! War. The king, I fear, hath ill-entreated her. Pem. Hard is the heart that injures such a saint. Y. Mor. I know ’tis long of Gaveston she weeps. E. Mor. Why? He is gone. Y. Mor. Madam, how fares your grace? Q. Isab. Ah, Mortimer! now breaks the king’s hate forth, And he confesseth that he loves me not. Y. Mor. Cry quittance, madam, then; and love not him. Q. Isab. No, rather will I die a thousand deaths! And yet I love in vain;—he'll ne’er love me. Lan, Fear ye not, madam; now his minion’s gone, His wanton humour will be quickly left. QO. Isab. O never, Lancaster! I am enjoin’d To sue upon you all for his repeal; This wills my lord, and this must I perform, Or else be banish’d from his highness’ presence. Lan. For his repeal? Madam, he comes not back, Unless the sea cast up his shipwreck’d body. War. And to behold so sweet a sight as that, There’s none here but would run his horse to death. Y. Mor. But, madam, would you have us call him home? Q. Isab. Ay, Mortimer, for till he be restor’d, The angry king hath banish’d me the court; And, therefore, as thou lov’st and tend’rest me, Be thou my advocate unto these peers. Y. Mor. What! would you have me plead for Gaveston? E. Mor. Plead for him he that will, I am resolv’d.

EDWARD THE SECOND 23 Lan. And so am I, my lord. Dissuade the queen. Q. Isab. O Lancaster! let him dissuade the king, For ’tis against my will he should return. War. Then speak not for him, let the peasant go. Q. Isab. "Tis for myself I speak, and not for him. Pem. No speaking will prevail, and therefore cease. Y. Mor. Fair queen, forbear to angle for the fish Which, being caught, strikes him that takes it dead; I mean that vile torpedo, Gaveston, That now, I hope, floats on the Irish seas. QO. Isab. Sweet Mortimer, sit down by me awhile, And I will tell thee reasons of such weight As thou wilt soon subscribe to his repeal. Y. Mor. It is impossible; but speak your mind. Q. Isab. Then thus, but none shall hear it but ourselves. [Talks to Young Mortimer apart.] Lan. My lords, albeit the queen win Mortimer, Will you be resolute, and hold with me? E. Mor. Not I, against my nephew. Pem. Fear not, the queen’s words cannot alter him. War. No? Do but mark how earnestly she pleads! Lan. And see how coldly his looks make denial! War. She smiles; now for my life his mind is chang’d! Lan. T'll rather lose his friendship, I, than grant. Y. Mor. Well, of necessity it must be so. My lords, that I abhor base Gaveston, I hope your honours make no question, And therefore, though I plead for his repeal, *Tis not for his sake, but for our avail; Nay for the realm’s behoof, and for the king’s. Lan. Fie, Mortimer, dishonour not thyself! Can this be true, ’twas good to banish him? And is this true, to call him home again? Such reasons make white black, and dark night day. Y. Mor. My lord of Lancaster, mark the respecté Lan. In no respect can contraries be true. ® Consideration.

24 MARLOWE Q. Isab. Yet, good my lord, hear what he can allege. War. All that he speaks is nothing; we are resolv’d. Y. Mor. Do you not wish that Gaveston were dead? Pem. 1 would he were! Y. Mor. Why, then, my lord, give me but leave to speak. E. Mor. But, nephew, do not play the sophister. Y. Mor. This which I urge is of a burning zeal To mend the king, and do our country good. Know you not Gaveston hath store of gold, Which may in Ireland purchase him such friends As he will front the mightest of us all? And whereas he shall live and be belov’d, *Tis hard for us to work his overthrow. War. Mark you but that, my lord of Lancaster. Y. Mor. But were he here, detested as he is, How easily might some base slave be suborn’d To greet his lordship with a poniard, And none so much as blame the murderer, But rather praise him for that brave attempt, And in the chronicle enrol his name For purging of the realm of such a plague! Pem. He saith true. Lan. Ay, but how chance this was not done before? Y. Mor. Because, my lords, it was not thought upon. Nay, more, when he shall know it lies in us To banish him, and then to call him home, ’Twill make him vail’ the top-flag of his pride, And fear to offend the meanest nobleman. E. Mor. But how if he do not, nephew? Y. Mor. Then may we with some colour rise in arms; For howsoever we have borne it out, ’Tis treason to be up against the king. So we shall have the people of our side, Which for his father’s sake lean to the king, But cannot brook a night-grown mushroom, ‘ Such a one as my lord of Cornwall is, 7 Lower.

EDWARD THE SECOND Should bear us down of the nobility. And when the commons and the nobles join, Tis not the king can buckler Gaveston; We'll pull him from the strongest hold he hath. My lords, if to perform this I be slack, Think me as base a groom as Gaveston. Lan. On that condition, Lancaster will grant. War. And so will Pembroke and I. E. Mor. And I. Y. Mor. In this I count me highly gratified, And Mortimer will rest at your command. Q. Isab. And when this favour Isabel forgets, Then let her live abandon’d and forlorn.— But see, in happy time, my lord the king, Having brought the Earl of Cornwall on his way, Is new return’d. This news will glad him much, Yet not so much as me. I love him more Than he can Gaveston; would he lov’d me But half so much, then were I treble-bless’d Re-enter Kinc Epwarp, mourning K. Edw. He’s gone, and for his absence thus I mourn. Did never sorrow go so near my heart As doth the want of my sweet Gaveston; And could my crown’s revenue bring him back, I would freely give it to his enemies, And think I gain’d,having bought so dear a friend. Q. Isab. Hark! how he harps upon his minion. K. Edw. My heart is as an anvil unto sorrow, Which beats upon it like the Cyclops’ hammers, And with the noise turns up my giddy brain, And makes me frantic for my Gaveston, Ah! had some bloodless Fury rose from hell, And with my kingly sceptre struck me dead, When I was forc’d to leave my Gaveston! Lan. Diablo! What passions call you these? Q. Isab. My gracious lord, I come to bring you news. 25

26 MARLOWE K. Edw. That you have parley’d with your Mortimer! Q. Isab, That Gaveston, my lord, shall be repeal’d. K. Edw. Repeal’d! The news is too sweet to be true? Q. Isab. But will you love me, if you find it so? K. Edw. If it be so, what will not Edward do? Q. Isab. For Gaveston, but not for Isabel. K. Edw. For thee, fair queen, if thou lov’st Gaveston. I'll hang a golden tongue about thy neck, Seeing thou hast pleaded with so good success. Q. Isab. No other jewels hang about my neck Than these, my lord; nor let me have more wealth Than I may fetch from this rich treasury. O how a kiss revives poor Isabel! K. Edw. Once more receive my hand; and let this be A second marriage ’twixt thyself and me. Q. Isab. And may it prove more happy than the first! My gentle lord, bespeak these nobles fair, That wait attendance for a gracious look, And on their knees salute your majesty. K. Edw. Courageous Lancaster, embrace thy king! And, as gross vapours perish by the sun, Even so let hatred with thy sovereign’s smile. Live thou with me as my companion. Lan. This salutation overjoys my heart. K. Edw. Warwick shall be my chiefest counsellor: These silver hairs will more adorn my court Than gaudy silks, or rich embroidery. Chide me, sweet Warwick, if I go astray. War. Slay me, my lord, when I offend your grace. K. Edw. In solemn triumphs, and in public shows, Pembroke shall bear the sword before the king. Pem. And with this sword Pembroke will fight for you. K. Edw. But wherefore walks young Mortimer aside? Be thou commander of our royal fleet; Or, if that lofty office like thee not, I make thee here Lord Marshal of the realm. Y. Mor. My lord, I'll marshal so your enemies,

EDWARD THE SECOND As England shall be quiet, and you safe. K. Edw. And as for you, Lord Mortimer of Chirke, Whose great achievements in our foreign war Deserves no common place nor mean reward, Be you the general of the levied troops, That now are ready to assail the Scots. E. Mor. In this your grace hath highly honoured me, For with my nature war doth best agree. Q. Isab. Now is the King of England rich and strong, Having the love of his renowned peers. K. Edw. Ay, Isabel, ne’er was my heart so light. Clerk of the crown, direct our warrant forth For Gaveston to Ireland: [Enter Beaumont with warrant.] Beaumont, fly As fast as Iris or Jove’s Mercury. Bea. It shall be done, my gracious lord. K. Edw. Lord Mortimer, we leave you to your charge. Now let us in, and feast it royally. Against our friend the Earl of Cornwall comes, We'll have a general tilt and tournament; And then his marriage shall be solemnis’d. For wot you not that I have made him sure® Unto our cousin, the Earl of Gloucester’s heir? Lan. Such news we hear, my lord. K. Edw. That day, if not for him, yet for my sake, Who in the triumph will be challenger, Spare for no cost; we will requit your love. War. In this, or aught, your highness shall command us. K. Edw. Thanks, gentle Warwick: come, let’s in and revel. 27 [Exit.] Exeunt all except the Mortmers. E. Mor. Nephew, I must to Scotland; thou stayest here. Leave now t’oppose thyself against the king. Thou seest by nature he is mild and calm, And, seeing his mind so doats on Gaveston, 8 Affianced him.

28 MARLOWE Let him without controlment have his will. The mightiest kings have had their minions: Great Alexander loved Hephestion; The conquering Hercules’ for Hylas wept; And for Patroclus stern Achilles drooped And not kings only, but the wisest men: The Roman Tully lov’d Octavius; Grave Socrates, wild Alcibiades. Then let his grace, whose youth is flexible, And promiseth as much as we can wish, Freely enjoy that vain, light-headed earl; For riper years will wean him from such toys. Y. Mor. Uncle, his wanton humour grieves not me; But this I scorn, that one so basely born Should by his sovereign’s favour grow so pert, And riot it with the treasure of the realm. While soldiers mutiny for want of pay, He wears a lord’s revenue on his back, And Midas-like, he jets® it in the court, With base outlandish cullions" at his heels, Whose proud fantastic liveries make such show As if that Proteus, god of shapes, appear’d. I have not seen a dapper Jack so brisk; He wears a short Italian hooded cloak Larded with pearl, and, in his Tuscan cap, A jewel of more value than the crown. While others walk below, the king and he From out a window laugh at such as we, And flout our train, and jest at our attire. Uncle, ’tis this that makes me impatient. E. Mor. But, nephew, now you see the king is chang’d. Y. Mor. Then so am I, and live to do him service: But whiles I have a sword, a hand, a heart, I will not yield to any such upstart. You know my mind; come, uncle, let’s away. Exeunt. °Qq. Hector. Struts. ™ Scoundrels.

EDWARD THE SECOND [ACT THE SECOND] [Scene I. Gloucester’s house] Enter Young Spencer and BaLpock Bald. Spencer, Seeing that our lord the Earl of Gloucester’s dead, Which of the nobles dost thou mean to serve? Y. Spen. Not Mortimer, nor any of his side, Because the king and he are enemies. Baldock, learn this of me, a factious lord Shall hardly do himself good, much less us; But he that hath the favour of a king, May with one word advance us while we live. The liberal Earl of Cornwall is the man On whose good fortune Spencer’s hopes depends. Bald. What, mean you then to be his follower? Y. Spen. No, his companion; for he loves me well, And would have once preferr’d me to the king. Bald. But he is banish’d; there’s small hope of him. Y. Spen. Ay, for a while; but, Baldock, mark the end. A friend of mine told me in secrecy That he’s repeal’d, and sent for back again; And even now a post came from the court With letters to our lady from the king; And as she read she smil’d, which makes me think It is about her lover Gaveston. Bald, ’Tis like enough; for since he was exil’d She neither walks abroad, nor comes in sight. But I had thought the match had been broke off, And that his banishment had chang’d her mind. Y. Spen. Our lady’s first love is not wavering; My life for thine, she will have Gaveston. Bald. Then hope I by her means to be preferr’d, Having read unto her since she was a child. Y. Spen. Then, Baldock, you must cast the scholar off, And learn to court it like a gentleman. 29

30 MARLOWE *Tis not a black coat and a little band, A velvet-cap’d coat, fac’d before with serge, And smelling to a nosegay all the day, Or holding of a napkin in your hand, Or saying a long grace at a table’s end, Or making low legs’ to a nobleman, Or looking downward with your eyelids close, And saying, “Truly, an’t” may please your honour,” Can get you any favour with great men; You must be proud, bold, pleasant, resolute, And now and then stab, as occasion serves. Bald. Spencer, thou know’st I hate such formal toys, And use them but of mere hypocrisy. Mine old lord whiles he liv’d was so precise, That he would take exceptions at my buttons, And being like pin’s heads, blame me for the bigness; Which made me curate-like in mine attire, Though inwardly licentious enough And apt for any kind of villainy. I am none of these common pedants, I, That cannot speak without propterea quod> Y.Spen. But one of those that saith guandoquidem, And hath a special gift to form a verb. Bald. Leave off this jesting, here my lady comes. Enter the Lady [Kine Epwarn’s Niece.] Niece. The grief for his exile was not so much As is the joy of his returning home. This letter came from my sweet Gaveston:— What need’st thou, love, thus to excuse thyself? I know thou could’st not come and visit me. [Reads.] “I will not long be from thee, though I die.” This argues the entire love of my lord; [Reads.] “When I forsake thee, death seize on my heart:” But stay thee here where Gaveston shall sleep. [Puts the letter into her bosom.] \Bows. If it. Lat. because. 4 Lat. since.

EDWARD THE SECOND 31 Now to the letter of my lord the king— . He wills me to repair unto the court, And meet my Gaveston? Why do I stay, Seeing that he talks thus of my marriage-day? Who’s there? Baldock! See that my coach be ready, I must hence. Bald. It shall be done, madam. Niece. And meet me at the park-pale presently. Exit Batpocx. Spencer, stay you and bear me company, For I have joyful news to tell thee of. My lord of Cornwall is a-coming over, And will be at the court as soon as we. Y. Spen. I knew the king would have him home again. Niece. If all things sort’ out as I hope they will, Thy service, Spencer, shall be thought upon. Y. Spen. 1 humbly thank your ladyship. Niece. Come, lead the way; I long till I am there. [Exeunt.] [Scene IT] Enter Kinc Epwarp, Quren Isapetta, Kent, Lancaster, Young Mortimer, Warwick, PemproxkeE, and Attendants : K. Edw. The wind is good, I wonder why he stays; I fear me he is wrack’d upon the sea. Q. Isab. Look, Lancaster, how passionate’ he is, And still his mind runs on his minion! Lan. My lord,— K. Edw. How now! what news? Is Gaveston arriv’d? Y. Mor. Nothing but Gaveston!|—What means your grace? You have matters of more weight to think upon; The King of France sets foot in Normandy. K. Edw. A trifle! we'll expel him when we please. But tell me, Mortimer, what’s thy device Against the stately triumph we decreed? Y. Mor. A homely one, my lord, not worth the telling. K. Edw. Pray thee let me know it. 5 Turn. | Sorrowful.

32 MARLOWE Y. Mor. But, seeing you are so desirous, thus it is: A lofty cedar-tree, fair flourishing, On whose top-branches kingly eagles perch, And by the bark a canker’ creeps me up, And gets into the highest bough of all: The motto, que tandem? K. Edw. And what is yours, my lord of Lancaster? Lan. My lord, mine’s more obscure than Mortimer’s. Pliny reports there is a flying fish Which all the other fishes deadly hate, And therefore, being pursued, it takes the air: No sooner is it up, but there’s a fowl That seizeth it; this fish, my lord, I bear: The motto this: Undique mors est.4 K. Edw. Proud Mortimer! ungentle Lancaster! Is this the love you bear your sovereign? Is this the fruit your reconcilement bears? Can you in words make show of amity, And in your shields display your rancorous minds! What call you this but private libelling Against the Earl of Cornwall and my brother? Q. Isab. Sweet husband, be content, they all love you. K. Edw. They love me not that hate my Gaveston, I am that cedar, shake me not too much; And you the eagles; soar ye ne’er so high, I have the jesses’ that will pull you down; And que tandem shall that canker cry Unto the proudest peer of Britainy. Though thou compar’st him to a flying fish, And threatenest death whether he rise or fall, *Tis not the hugest monster of the sea, Nor foulest harpy that shall swallow him. Y. Mor. If in his absence thus he favours him, What will he do whenas he shall be present? Lan, That shall we see; look where his lordship comes. 2Canker-worm. 3 Lat. Justly at length. 4Lat. On all sides is death. 5The straps round a hawk’s legs, to which the falconer’s leash was fastened.

EDWARD THE SECOND 33 Enter GAvESTON K. Edw. My Gaveston! Welcome to Tynemouth! Welcome to thy friend! Thy absence made me droop and pine away; For, as the lovers of fair Danae, When she was lock’d up in a brazen tower, Desired her more, and wax’d outrageous, So did it fare’ with me; and now thy sight Is sweeter far than was thy parting hence Bitter and irksome to my sobbing heart. Gav. Sweet lord and king, your speech preventeth’ mine, Yet have I words left to express my joy: The shepherd nipt with biting winter’s rage Frolics not more to see the painted spring, Than I do to behold your majesty. K. Edw. Will none of you salute my Gaveston? Lan. Salute him? yes. Welcome, Lord Chamberlain! Y. Mor. Welcome is the good Earl of Cornwall! War. Welcome, Lord Governor of the Isle of Man! Pem. Welcome, Master Secretary! Kent. Brother, do you hear them? K. Edw. Still will these earls and barons use me thus. Gav. My lord, I cannot brook these injuries. Q. Isab. Aye me, poor soul, when these begin to jar. [ Aside. ] K. Edw. Return it to their throats, Pll be thy warrant. Gav. Base, leaden earls, that glory in your birth, Go sit at home and eat your tenants’ beef; And come not here to scoff at Gaveston, Whose mounting thoughts did never creep so low As to bestow a look on such as you. Lan. Yet I disdain not to do this for you. [Draws his sword and offers to stab Gaveston.] K. Edw. Treason! treason! where’s the traitor? Pem. Here! here! K. Edw. Convey hence Gaveston; they’ll murder him. 6 Qq. 1594-1612, sure. 7 Anticipateth.

34 MARLOWE Gav. The life of thee shall salve this foul disgrace. Y. Mor. Villain! thy life, unless I miss mine aim. | Wounds Gaveston. ] Q. Isab. Ah! furious Mortimer, what hast thou done? Y. Mor. No more than I would answer, were he slain. [Exit Gaveston with Attendants. ] K. Edw. Yes, more than thou canst answer, though he live. Dear shall you both abye’® this riotous deed. Out of my presence! Come not near the court. Y. Mor. Pll not be barr’d the court for Gaveston. Lan. We'll hale him by the ears unto the block. K. Edw. Look to your own heads; his is sure enough. War. Look to your own crown, if you back him thus. Kent. Warwick, these words do ill beseem thy years. K. Edw. Nay, all of them conspire to cross me thus; But if I live, I'll tread upon their heads That think with high looks thus to tread me down. Come, Edmund, let’s away and levy men, *Tis war that must abate these barons’ pride. Exeunt Kine Epwarp, [QuEEN IsaBetta and Kent. ] War. Let’s to our castles, for the king is mov’d. Y. Mor. Mov’d may he be, and perish in his wrath! Lan. Cousin, it is no dealing with him now, He means to make us stoop by force of arms; And therefore let us jointly here protest, To persecute that Gaveston to the death. Y. Mor. By heaven, the abject villain shall not livel War. V’ll have his blood, or die in seeking it. Pem. The like oath Pembroke takes. Lan. And so doth Lancaster. Now send our heralds to defy the king; And make the people swear to put him down. [Enter a Messenger ] Y. Mor. Letters! From whence? Mess. From Scotland, my lord. [Giving letters to Mortimer. ] 8 Pay for.

EDWARD THE SECOND Lan. Why, how now, cousin, how fares all our friends? Y. Mor. My uncle’s taken prisoner by the Scots. Lan. We'll have him ransom’d, man; be of good cheer. Y. Mor. They rate his ransom at five thousand pound, Who should defray the money but the king, Seeing he is taken prisoner in his wars? Tl to the king. Lan. Do, cousin, and I'll bear thee company. War. Meantime, my lord of Pembroke and myself Will to Newcastle here, and gather head.’ Y. Mor. About it then, and we will follow you. Lan. Be resolute and full of secrecy. 35 War. | warrant you. [Exit with PEMBROKE. | Y. Mor. Cousin, and if he will not ransom him, I'll thunder such a peal into his ears, As never subject did unto his king. Lan. Content, I’ll bear my part—Holla! who’s there? [Enter Guard] Y. Mor. Ay, marry, such a guard as this doth well. Lan. Lead on the way. Guard. Whither will your lordships? Y. Mor. Whither else but to the king. Guard. His highness is dispos’d to be alone. Lan. Why, so he may, but we will speak to him. Guard. You may not in, my lord. Y. Mor. May we not? [Enter Kinc Epwarp and Kent] K. Edw. How now! What noise is this? Who have we there? Is’t you? Y. Mor. Nay, stay, my lord, I come to bring you news; Mine uncle’s taken prisoner by the Scots. K. Edw. Then ransom him. Lan. ’Twas in your wars; you should ransom him. Y. Mor. And you shall ransom him, or else— 9 An army. [Going.]

36 MARLOWE Kent. What! Mortimer, you will not threaten him? K. Edw. Quiet yourself, you shall have the broad seal, To gather for him throughout the realm. Lan. Your minion Gaveston hath taught you this. Y. Mor. My lord, the family of the Mortimers Are not so poor, but, would they sell their land, *Twould levy men enough to anger you. We never beg, but use such prayers as these. K. Edw. Shall I still be haunted thus? Y. Mor. Nay, now you're here alone, I'll speak my mind. Lan. And so will I, and then, my lord, farewell. Y. Mor. The idle triumphs, masks, lascivious shows, And prodigal gifts bestow’d on Gaveston, Have drawn thy treasury dry, and made thee weak; The murmuring commons, overstretched, break. Lan. Look for rebellion, look to be depos’d. Thy garrisons are beaten out of France, And, lame and poor, lie groaning at the gates. The wild O’Neill, with swarms of Irish kerns,"° Lives uncontroll’d within the English pale. Unto the walls of York the Scots made road," And unresisted drave away rich spoils. Y. Mor. The haughty Dane commands the narrow seas, While in the harbour ride thy ships unrigg’d. Lan. What foreign prince sends thee ambassadors? Y. Mor. Who loves thee, but a sort” of flatterers? Lan. Thy gentle queen, sole sister to Valois, Complains that thou hast left her all forlorn. Y. Mor. Thy court is naked, being bereft of those That make a king seem glorious to the world; I mean the peers, whom thou should’st dearly love. Libels are cast again thee in the street; Ballads and rhymes made of thy overthrow. Lan. The Northern borderers seeing their houses burnt, Their wives and children slain, run up and down, Cursing the name of thee and Gaveston. 10 Foot soldiers. 4Inroad. 2 Band.

EDWARD THE SECOND 37 Y. Mor. When wert thou in the field with banner spread, But once? and then thy soldiers marched like players, With garish robes, not armour; and thyself, Bedaub’d with gold, rode laughing at the rest, Nodding and shaking of thy spangled crest, Where women’s favours hung like labels down. Lan. And therefore came it, that the fleering™ Scots, To England’s high disgrace, have made this jig; “Maids of England, sore may you mourn,— For your lemans'* you have lost at Bannocksbourn,— With a heave and a ho! What weeneth the King of England, So soon to have won Scotland?— With a rombelow!” Y. Mor. Wigmore” shall fly, to set my uncle free. Lan. And when ’tis gone, our swords shall purchase more. If ye be mov’d, revenge it as you can; Look next to see us with our ensigns spread. Exit with Young Mortimer. K. Edw. My swelling heart for very anger breaks! How oft have I been baited by these peers, And dare not be reveng’d, for their power is great! Yet, shall the crowing of these cockerels Affright a lion? Edward, unfold thy paws, And let their lives’ blood slake thy fury’s hunger. If I be cruel and grow tyrannous, Now let them thank themselves, and rue too late. Kent. My lord, I see your love to Gaveston Will be the ruin of the realm and you, For now the wrathful nobles threaten wars, And therefore, brother, banish him for ever. K. Edw. Art thou an enemy to my Gaveston? Kent. Ay, and it grieves me that I favoured him. K. Edw. Traitor, begone! whine thou with Mortimer. Kent. So will I, rather than with Gaveston. 3 Jeering. 14 Lovers. 15 Bannockburn was not yet fought. The rhyme is taken from the Chronicles. 18 Young Mortimer’s estate. 5

38 MARLOWE K. Edw. Out of my sight, and trouble me no more! Kent. No marvel though thou scorn thy noble peers, When I thy brother am rejected thus. K. Edw. Away! Exit Kent. Poor Gaveston, that has no friend but me, Do what they can, we'll live in Tynemouth here, And, so I walk with him about the walls, What care I though the earls begirt us round?— Here comes she that is cause of all these jars. Enter Queen Isanetta with [Kine Epwarn’s Niece, two] Ladies, [Gavesron,] Batpock and Young SPENCER Q. Isab. My lord, ’tis thought the earls are up in arms. K. Edw. Ay, and ’tis likewise thought you favour ’em. Q. Isab. Thus do you still suspect me without cause? Niece. Sweet uncle! speak more kindly to the queen. Gav. My lord, dissemble with her, speak her fair. K. Edw. Pardon me, sweet, I forgot myself. Q. Isab. Your pardon is quickly got of Isabel. K. Edw. The younger Mortimer is grown so brave, That to my face he threatens civil wars. Gav. Why do you not commit him to the Tower? K. Edw.1 dare not, for the people love him well. Gav. Why, then we'll have him privily made away. K. Edw. Would Lancaster and he had both carous’d A bowl of poison to each other’s health! But let them go, and tell me what are these? Niece. Two of my father’s servants whilst he liv’d,— May’st please your grace to entertain them now. K. Edw. Tell me, where wast thou born? What is thine arms? Bald. My name is Baldock, and my gentry I fetch from Oxford, not from heraldry. K. Edw. The fitter art thou, Baldock, for my turn. Wait on me, and Pll see thou shalt not want. Bald. 1 humbly thank your majesty. K. Edw. Knowest thou him, Gaveston?

EDWARD THE SECOND 39 Gav. Ay, my lord; His name is Spencer, he is well allied; For my sake, let him wait upon your grace; Scarce shall you find a man of more desert. K. Edw. Then, Spencer, wait upon me; for his sake I'll grace thee with a higher style ere long. Y. Spen. No greater titles happen unto me, Than to be favoured of your majesty! K. Edw. Cousin, this day shall be your marriage-feast. And, Gaveston, think that I love thee well, To wed thee to our niece, the only heir Unto the Earl of Gloucester late deceas’d. Gav. 1 know, my lord, many will stomach” me, But I respect neither their love nor hate. K. Edw. The headstrong barons shall not limit me; He that I list to favour shall be great. Come, let’s away; and when the marriage ends, Have at the rebels, and their ’complices! Exeunt. (Scrnez III. Near Tynemouth Castle] Enter Kent, Lancaster, Young Mortimer, Warwick, PEMBROKE, and others Kent. My lords, of love to this our native land I come to join with you and leave the king; And in your quarrel and the realm’s behoof Will be the first that shall adventure life. Lan. fear me, you are sent of policy, To undermine us with a show of love. War. He is your brother, therefore have we cause To cast’ the worst, and doubt of your revolt. Kent. Mine honour shall be hostage of my truth; If that will not suffice, farewell, my lords. Y. Mor. Stay, Edmund; never was Plantagenet False to his word, and therefore trust we thee. Pem. But what’s the reason you should leave him now? 17 Feel resentment at. 4 Suspect.

40 MARLOWE Kent. I have inform’d the Earl of Lancaster. Lan. And it sufficeth. Now, my lords, know this, That Gaveston is secretly arriv’d, And here in Tynemouth frolics with the king. Let us with these our followers scale the walls, And suddenly surprise them unawares. Y. Mor. I'll give the onset. War. And I'll follow thee. Y. Mor. This tottered’ ensign of my ancestors Which swept the desert shore of that dead sea Whereof we got the name of Mortimer, Will I advance upon these castle-walls. Drums, strike alarum, raise them from their sport, And ring aloud the knell of Gaveston! Lan. None be so hardy as to touch the king; But neither spare you Gaveston nor his friends. Exeunt. [Scene IV. Near Tynemouth Castle] Enter Kinc Epwarp and Young SpENcER K. Edw. O tell me, Spencer, where is Gaveston? Spen. I fear he is slain, my gracious lord. K. Edw. No, here he comes; now let them spoil and kill. [Enter QugEEN IsaBELLA, Kinc Epwarp’s Niece, GavesTon, and Nobles] Fly, fly, my lords, the earls have got the hold; Take shipping and away to Scarborough; Spencer and I will post away by land. Gav. O stay, my lord, they will not injure you. K. Edw. 1 will not trust them; Gaveston, away! Gav. Farewell, my lord. K. Edw. Lady, farewell. Niece. Farewell, sweet uncle, till we meet again. K. Edw. Farewell, sweet Gaveston; and farewell, niece. Q. Isab. No farewell to poor Isabel thy queen? 2 Tattered.

EDWARD THE SECOND 4! K. Edw. Yes, yes, for Mortimer, your lover’s sake. Exeunt all but QueEn IsaBELLa. Q. Isab. Heavens can witness I love none but you: From my embracements thus he breaks away. O that mine arms could close this isle about, That I might pull him to me where I would! Or that these tears that drizzle from mine eyes Had power to mollify his stony heart, That when I had him we might never part. Enter Lancaster, Warwick, Young Mortimer, and others. Alarums Lan. 1 wonder how he scap’d! Y. Mor. Who’s this? The queen! Q. Isab. Ay, Mortimer, the miserable queen, Whose pining heart her inward sighs have blasted, And body with continual mourning wasted: These hands are tir’d with haling of my lord From Gaveston, from wicked Gaveston, And all in vain; for, when I speak him fair, _ He turns away, and smiles upon his minion. Y. Mor. Cease to lament, and tell us where’s the king? Q. Isab. What would you with the king? Is’t him you seek? Lan. No, madam, but that cursed Gaveston. Far be it from the thought of Lancaster To offer violence to his sovereign. We would but rid the realm of Gaveston: Tell us where he remains, and he shall die. Q. Isab. He’s gone by water unto Scarborough; Pursue him quickly, and he cannot ’scape; The king hath left him, and his train is small. War. Foreslow' no time, sweet Lancaster; let’s march. Y. Mor. How comes it that the king and he is parted? Q. Isab. That thus your army, going several ways, Might be of lesser force; and with the power That he intendeth presently’ to raise, Be easily suppress’d; therefore be gone. 1Delay. 2 Immediately.

42 MARLOWE Y. Mor. Here in the river rides a Flemish hoy; Let’s all aboard, and follow him amain. Lan. The wind that bears him hence will fill our sails: Come, come aboard, ’tis but an hour’s sailing. Y. Mor. Madam, stay you within this castle here. Q. Isab, No, Mortimer, Pll to my lord the king. Y. Mor. Nay, rather sail with us to Scarborough, Q. Isab. You know the king is so suspicious, As if he hear I have but talk’d with you, Mine honour will be call’d in question; And therefore, gentle Mortimer, be gone. Y. Mor. Madam, I cannot stay to answer you, But think of Mortimer as he deserves. [Exeunt all except QuEEN IsaBELLA.] OQ. Isab. So well hast thou deserv’d sweet Mortimer, As Isabel could live with thee for ever! In vain I look for love at Edward’s hand, Whose eyes are fix’d on none but Gaveston; Yet once more I’ll importune him with prayers. If he be strange and not regard my words, My son and I will over into France, And to the king my brother there complain, How Gaveston hath robb’d me of his love: But yet I hope my sorrows will have end, And Gaveston this blessed day be slain. Exit. [Scene V] Enter Gaveston, pursued Gav. Yet, lusty lords, I have escap’d your hands, Your threats, your ‘larums, and your hot pursuits; And though divorced from King Edward’s eyes, Yet liveth Pierce of Gaveston unsurpris’d,' Breathing, in hope (malgrado’ all your beards, That muster rebels thus against your king), To see his royal sovereign once again. 1Uncaptured. ? Ital. in spite of.

EDWARD THE SECOND 43 Enter [Warwicx, Lancaster, PEMBROKE, Young Mortimes, Soldiers, James, and other Attendants of Pemsroxe] War. Upon him, soldiers, take away his weapons. Y. Mor. Thou proud disturber of thy country’s peace, Corrupter of thy king, cause of these broils, Base flatterer, yield! and were it not for shame, Shame and dishonour to a soldier’s name, Upon my weapon’s point here should’st thou fall, And welter in thy gore. Lan. Monster of men! That, like the Greekish strumpet,’ train’d‘ to arms And bloody wars so many valiant knights; Look for no other fortune, wretch, than death! King Edward is not here to buckler thee. War. Lancaster, why talk’st thou to the slave? Go, soldiers, take him hence, for, by my sword, His head shall off. Gaveston, short warning Shall serve thy turn; it is our country’s cause That here severely we will execute Upon thy person. Hang him at a bough. Gav. My lord!— War. Soldiers, have him away;— But for thou wert the favourite of a king, Thou shalt have so much honour at our hands— Gav. I thank you all, my lords: then I perceive, That heading is one, and hanging is the other, And death is all. Enter Eart of ARUNDEL Lan. How now, my lord of Arundel? Arun, My lords, King Edward greets you all by me. War. Arundel, say your message. Arun. His majesty, Hearing that you had taken Gaveston, Entreateth you by me, yet but he may See him before he dies; for why, he says, 3 Helen of Troy. 4 Drew.

44 MARLOWE And sends you word, he knows that die he shall; And if you gratify his grace so far, He will be mindful of the courtesy. War. How now? Gav. Renownéd Edward, how thy name Revives poor Gaveston! War. No, it needeth not; Arundel, we will gratify the king In other matters; he must pardon us in this. Soldiers, away with him! Gav. Why, my lord of Warwick, Will not these delays beget my hopes? I know it, lords, it is this life you aim at, Yet grant King Edward this. Y. Mor. Shalt thou appoint What we shall grant? Soldiers, away with him! Thus we'll gratify the king: We'll send his head by thee; let him bestow His tears on that, for that is all he gets Of Gaveston, or else his senseless trunk. Lan. Not so, my lords, lest he bestow more cost In burying him than he hath ever earn’d. Arun. My lords, it is his majesty’s request, And in the honour of a king he swears, He will but talk with him, and send him back. War. When? can you tell? Arundel, no; we wot He that the care of his realm remits, And drives his nobles to these exigents’ For Gaveston, will, if he sees* him once, Violate any promises to possess him. Arun. Then if you will not trust his grace in keep, My lords, I will be pledge for his return. Y. Mor. ’Tis honourable in thee to offer this; But for we know thou art a noble gentleman, We will not wrong thee so, to make away A true man for a thief. 5 Extremities. © Cunningham’s emendation for Q.zease.

EDWARD THE SECOND 45 Gav. How mean’st thou, Mortimer? That is over-base. Y. Mor. Away, base groom, robber of king’s renown! Question with thy companions and thy mates. Pem. My Lord Mortimer, and you, my lords, each one, To gratify the king’s request therein, Touching the sending of this Gaveston, Because his majesty so earnestly Desires to see the man before his death, I will upon mine honour undertake To carry him, and bring him back again; Provided this, that you my lord of Arundel Will join with me. War. Pembroke, what wilt thou do? Cause yet more bloodshed? Is it not enough "That we have taken him, but must we now Leave him on “had I wist,”’ and let him go? Pem. My lords, I will not over-woo your honours, But if you dare trust Pembroke with the prisoner, Upon mine oath, I will return him back. Arun. My lord of Lancaster, what say you in this? Lan. Why, I say, let him go on Pembroke’s word. Pem. And you, Lord Mortimer? Y. Mor. How say you, my lord of Warwick? War. Nay, do your pleasures, I know how ’twill prove. Pem. Then give him me. Gav. Sweet sovereign, yet I come To see thee ere I die. War. Yet not perhaps, If Warwick’s wit and policy prevail. [ Aside. ] Y. Mor. My lord of Pembroke, we deliver him you; Return him on your honour. Sound, away! Exeunt all except PEMBROKE, ARUNDEL, GAVESTON, [James,] and other Attendants of PEMBROKE. Pem. [My lord of Arundel,] you shall go with me. My house is not far hence; out of the way 7“Had I known—the exclamation of those who repent of what they have rashly done.” Dyce.

46 MARLOWE A little, but our men shall go along. We that have pretty wenches to our wives, Sir, must not come so near and baulk their lips. Arun. "Tis very kindly spoke, my lord of Pembroke; Your honour hath an adamant of power To draw a prince. Pem. So, my lord. Come hither, James: I do commit this Gaveston to thee, Be thou this night his keeper; in the morning We will discharge thee of thy charge. Be gone. Gav. Unhappy Gaveston, whither goest thou now? Exit with James and the other Attendants. Horse-boy. My lord, we'll quickly be at Cobham. Exeunt. [ACT THE THIRD] [Scene I] Enter Gaveston mourning, James, and other Attendants of . PEMBROKE Gav. O treacherous Warwick! thus to wrong thy friend. James. I see it is your life these arms pursue. Gav. Weaponless must I fall, and die in bands? O! must this day be period of my life? Centre of all my bliss! An ye be men, Speed to the king. War. My lord of Pembroke’s men, Strive you no longer—I will have that Gaveston. James. Your lordship does dishonour to yourself, And wrong our lord, your honourable friend. War. No, James, it is my country’s cause I follow. Go, take the villain; soldiers, come away. We'll make quick work. Commend me to your master, My friend, and tell him that I watch’d it well. Come, let thy shadow’ parley with King Edward. 1 Ghost.

EDWARD THE SECOND 47 Gav. Treacherous earl, shall I not see the king? War. The king of Heaven, perhaps; no other king. Away! Exeunt Warwick and Soldiers with GavEston, James. Come, fellows, it booted not for us to strive, We will in haste go certify our lord. Exeunt. [Scene IT] Enter Kine Epwarv and [Young] Spencer, [Batpocx, and Nobles of the Kine’s side, and Soldiers] with drums and fifes K. Edw. 1 long to hear an answer from the barons Touching my friend, my dearest Gaveston. Ah! Spencer, not the riches of my realm Can ransom him! Ah, he is mark’d to diel I know the malice of the younger Mortimer, Warwick I know is rough, and Lancaster Inexorable, and I shall never see My lovely Pierce, my Gaveston again! The barons overbear me with their pride. _ Y. Spen. Were I King Edward, England’s sovereign, Son to the lovely Eleanor of Spain, Great Edward Longshanks’ issue, would I bear These braves, this rage, and suffer uncontroll’d These barons thus to beard me in my land, In mine own realm? My lord, pardon my speech: Did you retain your father’s magnanimity, Did you regard the honour of your name, You would not suffer thus your majesty Be counterbuff'd of’ your nobility. Strike off their heads, and let them preach on poles! No doubt, such lessons they will teach the rest, As by their preachments they will profit much, And learn obedience to their lawful king. K., Edw. Yea, gentle Spencer, we have been too mild, Too kind to them; but now have drawn our sword, And if they send me not my Gaveston, 1 Checked by.

48 MARLOWE We'll steel it on their crest, and poll their tops. Bald. This haught’ resolve becomes your majesty, Not to be tied to their affection, As though your highness were a schoolboy still, And must be aw’d and govern’d like a child. Enter the Elder Spencer, with his truncheon and Soldiers E. Spen. Long live my sovereign, the noble Edward, In peace triumphant, fortunate in wars! K. Edw. Welcome, old man, com’st thou in Edward’s aid? Then tell thy prince of whence, and what thou art. E. Spen. Lo, with a band of bowmen and of pikes, Brown bills and targeteers, four hundred strong, Sworn to defend King Edward’s royal right, I come in person to your majesty, Spencer, the father of Hugh Spencer there, Bound to your highness everlastingly, For favour done, in him, unto us all. K. Edw. Thy father, Spencer ? Y. Spen. True, an it like your grace, That pours, in lieu of all your goodness shown, His life, my lord, before your princely feet. K. Edw. Welcome ten thousand times, old man, again. Spencer, this love, this kindness to thy king, Argues thy noble mind and disposition. Spencer, I here create thee Earl of Wiltshire, And daily will enrich thee with our favour, That, as the sunshine, shall reflect o’er thee. Beside, the more to manifest our love, Because we hear Lord Bruce doth sell his land, And that the Mortimers are in hand withal, Thou shalt have crowns of us t’ outbid the barons: And, Spencer, spare them not, but lay it on. Soldiers, a largess, and thrice welcome all! Y. Spen. aa! lord, here comes the queen. 2 High-spirited.

EDWARD THE SECOND 49 Enter Queen IsaseLia, and her son [Prince Epwaro,| and Levune, a Frenchman K. Edw. Madam, what news? Q. Isab. News of dishonour, lord, and discontent. Our friend Levune, faithful and full of trust, Informeth us, by letters and by words, That Lord Valois our brother, King of France, Because your highness hath been slack in homage, Hath seized Normandy into his hands. These be the letters, this the messenger. K. Edw. Welcome, Levune. Tush, Sib, if this be all Valois and I will soon be friends again — But to my Gaveston; shall I never see, Never behold thee now?—Madam, in this matter, We will employ you and your little son; You shall go parley with the King of France— Boy, see you bear you bravely to the king, And do your message with a majesty. P, Edw. Commit not to my youth things of more weight Than fits a prince so young as I to bear, And fear not, lord and father, Heaven’s great beams On Atlas’ shoulder shall not lie more safe, Than shall your charge committed to my trust. Q. Isab. Ah, boy! this towardness makes thy mother fear Thou art not mark’d to many days on earth. K. Edw. Madam, we will that you with speed be shipp’d, And this our son; Levune shall follow you With all the haste we can despatch him hence. Choose of our lords to bear you company, And go in peace; leave us in wars at home. Q. Isab. Unnatural wars, where subjects brave their king; God end them once! My lords, I take my leave, To make my preparation for France. [Exit with Prince Epwaro.]

50 MARLOWE [Enter ArunpeL. |* K. Edw. What, Lord Arundel, dost thou come alone? Arun. Yea, my good lord, for Gaveston is dead. K. Edw. Ah, traitors! have they put my friend to death? Tell me, Arundel, died he ere thou cam’st, Or didst thou see my friend to take his death? Arun. Neither, my lord; for as he was surpris’d, Begirt with weapons and with enemies round, I did your highness’ message to them all; Demanding him of them, entreating rather, And said, upon the honour of my name, That I would undertake to carry him Unto your highness, and to bring him back. K. Edw. And tell me, would the rebels deny me that? Y. Spen. Proud recreants! K. Edw. Yea, Spencer, traitors all. Arun. I found them at the first inexorable; The Earl of Warwick would not bide the hearing, Mortimer hardly; Pembroke and Lancaster Spake least: and when they flatly had denied, Refusing to receive me pledge for him, The Earl of Pembroke mildly thus bespake; “My lords, because our sovereign sends for him, And promiseth he shall be safe return’d, I will this undertake, to have him hence, And see him re-delivered to your hands.” K. Edw. Well, and how fortunes [it] that he came not? Y. Spen. Some treason, or some villainy, was the cause. Arun. The Earl of Warwick seiz’d him on his way; For being delivered unto Pembroke’s men, Their lord rode home thinking his prisoner safe; But ere he came, Warwick in ambush lay, And bare him to his death; and in a trench Strake off his head, and march’d unto the camp. Y. Spen. A bloody part, flatly ’gainst law of arms! 3Qq. Lord Matre[vis], throughout the scene. Corrected by Dyce.

EDWARD THE SECOND K. Edw. O shall I speak, or shall I sigh and die! Y. Spen. My lord, refer your vengeance to the sword Upon these barons; hearten up your men; Let them not unreveng’d murder your friends! Advance your standard, Edward, in the field, And march to fire them from their starting holes. 51 K. Edw. (kneeling.) By earth, the common mother of us all, By Heaven, and all the moving orbs thereof, By this right hand, and by my father’s sword, And all the honours ‘longing to my crown, I will have heads, and lives for him, as many As I have manors, castles, towns, and towers!—Treacherous Warwick! traitorous Mortimer]! If it be England’s king, in lakes of gore Your headless trunks, your bodies will I trail, That you may drink your fill, and quaff in blood, And stain my royal standard with the same, That so my bloody colours may suggest Remembrance of revenge immortally On your accursed traitorous progeny, You villains, that have slain my Gaveston! And in this place of honour and of trust, Spencer, sweet Spencer, I adopt thee here: And merely of our love we do create thee Earl of Gloucester, and Lord Chamberlain, Despite of times, despite of enemies. Y. Spen. My lord, here’s a messenger from the barons. Desires access unto your majesty. K. Edw. Admit him near. Enter the Herald, with his coat of arms Her. Long live King Edward, England’s lawful lord! K. Edw. So wish not they, I wis, that sent thee hither. Thou com’st from Mortimer and his ’complices, A ranker rout of rebels never was. Well, say thy message. Her. The barons up in arms, by me salute [Rises.]

52 MARLOWE Your highness with long life and happiness; And bid me say, as plainer to your grace, That if without effusion of blood You will this grief have ease and remedy, That from your princely person you remove This Spencer, as a putrifying branch, That deads the royal vine, whose golden leaves Empale your princely head, your diadem, Whose brightness such pernicious upstarts dim, Say they; and lovingly advise your grace, To cherish virtue and nobility, And have old servitors in high esteem, And shake off smooth dissembling flatterers. This granted, they, their honours, and their lives, Are to your highness vow’d and consecrate. Y. Spen. Ah, traitors! will they still display their pride? K. Edw. Away, tarry no answer, but be gone! Rebels, will they appoint their sovereign His sports, his pleasures, and his company? Yet, ere thou go, see how I do divorce Embraces SpENcER. Spencer from me.—Now get thee to thy lords, And tell them I will come to chastise them For murdering Gaveston; hie thee, get thee gone! Edward with fire and sword follows at thy heels. [Exit Herald.] My lords, perceive you how these rebels swell? Soldiers, good hearts, defend your sovereign’s right, For now, even now, we march to make them stoop. Away! Exeunt. Alarums, excursions, a great fight, and a retreat | sounded, within]. [Scene III. Battlefield at Boroughbridge in Yorkshire] Re-enter Kine Epwarp, the Elder Spencer, Young Spencer, and Noblemen of the Kine’s side K. Edw. Why do we sound retreat? Upon them, lords! This day I shall pour vengeance with my sword On those proud rebels that are up in arms And do confront and countermand their king,

EDWARD THE SECOND 53 Y. Spen. I doubt it not, my lord, right will prevail. E. Spen. ’Tis not amiss, my liege, for either part To breathe awhile; our men, with sweat and dust All choked well near, begin to faint for heat; And this retire refresheth horse and man. Y. Spen. Here come the rebels. Enter Young Mortimer, Lancaster, Warwick, PEMBROKE, and others. Y. Mor. Look, Lancaster, yonder is Edward Among his flatterers. Lan. And there let him be Till he pay dearly for their company. War. And shall, or Warwick’s sword shall smite in vain. K. Edw. What, rebels, do you shrink and sound retreat? Y. Mor. No, Edward, no; thy flatterers faint and fly. Lan. They’d best betimes forsake thee, and their trains, For they’ll betray thee, traitors as they are. Y. Spen. Traitor on thy face, rebellious Lancaster! Pem. Away, base upstart, bravest thou nobles thus? E. Spen. A noble attempt and honourable deed, Is it not, trow ye, to assemble aid, And levy arms against your lawful king! K. Edw. For which ere long their heads shall satisfy, To appease the wrath of their offended king. Y. Mor. Then, Edward, thou wilt fight it to the last, And rather bathe thy sword in subjects’ blood, Than banish that pernicious company? K. Edw. Ay, traitors all, rather than thus be brav’d, Make England’s civil towns huge heaps of stones, And ploughs to go about our palace-gates. War. A desperate and unnatural resolution! Alarum! To the fight! . St. George for England, and the barons’ right! K. Edw. Saint George for England, and King Edward’s right! [ Alarums. Exeunt the two parties severally.] 1 Plots.

54 MARLOWE [Scene IV} Re-enter Kinc Epwarp [and his followers,| with the Barons [and Kent], captives K. Edw. Now, lusty lords, now, not by chance of war, But justice of the quarrel and the cause, Vail’d’ is your pride; methinks you hang the heads, But we'll advance them, traitors. Now ’tis time To be avenged on you for all your braves, And for the murder of my dearest friend, To whom right well you knew our soul was knit, Good Pierce of Gaveston, my sweet favourite. Ah, rebels! recreants! you made him away. Kent. Brother, in regard of thee, and of thy land, Did they remove that flatterer from thy throne. K. Edw. So, sir, you have spoke; away, avoid our presence. [Ext Kenr.] Accursed wretches, was’t in regard of us, When we had sent our messenger to request He might be spar’d to come to speak with us, And Pembroke undertook for his return, That thou, proud Warwick, watch’d the prisoner, Poor Pierce, and headed him ’gainst law of arms? For which thy head shall overlook the rest, As much as thou in rage outwent’st the rest. War. Tyrant, I scorn thy threats and menaces; It is but temporal that thou canst inflict. Lan. The worst is death, and better die to live Than live in infamy under such a king. K. Edw. Away with them, my lord of Winchester! These lusty leaders, Warwick and Lancaster, I charge you roundly—off with both their heads! Away! War. Farewell, vain world! Lan, Sweet Mortimer, farewell. 2 Lowered.

EDWARD THE SECOND 55 Y. Mor. England, unkind to thy nobility, Groan for this grief, behold how thou art maim’d! K. Edw. Go take that haughty Mortimer to the Tower, There see him safe bestow’d; and for the rest, Do speedy execution on them all. Begone! Y. Mor. What, Mortimer! can ragged stony walls Immure thy virtue that aspires to Heaven? No, Edward, England’s scourge, it may not be; Mortimer’s hope surmounts his fortune far. [The captive Barons are led off.] K. Edw. Sound drums and trumpets! March with me, my friends, Edward this day hath crown’d him king anew. Exeunt all except Young Spencer, Levune, and Baupock. Y. Spen. Levune, the trust that we repose in thee, Begets the quiet of King Edward’s land. Therefore begone in haste, and with advice Bestow that treasure on the lords of France, That, therewith all enchanted, like the guard That suffered Jove to pass in showers of gold To Danae, all aid may be denied To Isabel, the queen, that now in France Makes friends, to cross the seas with her young son, And step into his father’s regiment. Levune. That’s it these barons and the subtle queen Long levell’d at. Bal. Yea, but, Levune, thou seest These barons lay their heads on blocks together; What they intend, the hangman frustrates clean. Levune. Have you no doubt, my lords, I'll clap so close Among the lords of France with England’s gold, That Isabel shall make her plaints in vain, And France shall be obdurate with her tears. Y. Spen. Then make for France, amain—Levune, away! Proclaim King Edward’s wars and victories. Exeunt. 3 Rule.

56 MARLOWE [ACT THE FOURTH] [Scenz I. Near the Tower of London] Enter Kent Kent. Fair blows the wind for France; blow gentle gale, Till Edmund be arriv’d for England’s good! Nature, yield to my country’s cause in this. A brother? No, a butcher of thy friends! Proud Edward, dost thou banish me thy presence? But I'll to France, and cheer the wronged queen, And certify what Edward’s looseness is. - Unnatural king! to slaughter noblemen And cherish flatterers! Mortimer, I stay Thy sweet escape: stand gracious, gloomy night, To his device. Enter Young Mortimer, disguised Y. Mor. Holla! who walketh there? Is’t you, my lord? Kent. Mortimer, ’tis I; But hath thy potion wrought so happily? Y. Mor. It hath, my Lord; the warders all asleep, I thank them, gave me leave to pass in peace. But hath your grace got shipping unto France? Kent. Fear it not. [Scene II. Paris} Enter Queen Isapetta and Prince Epwarp Q. Isab. Ah, boy! our friends do fail us all in France. The lords are cruel, and the king unkind; What shall we do? P, Edw. Madam, return to England, And please my father well, and then a fig For all my uncle’s friendship here in France. I warrant you, I'll win his highness quickly; ’A loves me better than a thousand Spencers. Exeunt.

EDWARD THE SECOND Q. Isab. Ah, boy, thou art deceiv’d, at least in this, To think that we can yet be tun’d together; No, no, we jar too far. Unkind Valois! Unhappy Isabel! when France rejects, Whither, oh! whither dost thou bend thy steps? Enter Sir Joun oF Harnautt Sir J. Madam, what cheer? OQ. Isab. Ah! good Sir John of Hainault, Never so cheerless, nor so far distrest. Sir ]. I hear, sweet lady, of the king’s unkindness; But droop not, madam; noble minds contemn Despair. Will your grace with me to Hainault, And there stay time’s advantage with your son? How say you, my lord, will you go with your friends, And shake off all our fortunes equally? P. Edw. So pleaseth the queen, my mother, me it likes. The King of England, nor the court of France, Shall have me from my gracious mother’s side, Till I be strong enough to break a staff; And then have at the proudest Spencer’s head. Sir ]. Well said, my lord. Q. Isab. O, my sweet heart, how do I moan thy wrongs, Yet triumph in the hope of thee, my joy! Ah, sweet Sir John! even to the utmost verge Of Europe, or the shore of Tanais, Will we with thee to Hainault—so we will:— The marquis is a noble gentleman; His grace, I dare presume, will welcome me. But who are these? Enter Kent and Young Mortimer Kent. Madam, long may you live, Much happier than your friends in England do! Q. Isab. Lord Edmund and Lord Mortimer alive! Welcome to France! The news was here, my lord, That you were dead, or very near your death.

58 MARLOWE Y. Mor. Lady, the last was truest of the twain; But Mortimer, reserv’d for better hap, Hath shaken off the thraldom of the Tower, And lives t' advance your standard, good my lord. P,. Edw. How mean you? An’ the king, my father, lives? No, my Lord Mortimer, not I, I trow. Q. Isab. Not, son! why not? I would it were no worse. But, gentle lords, friendless we are in France. Y. Mor. Monsieur le Grand, a noble friend of yours, Told us, at our arrival, all the news: How hard the nobles, how unkind the king Hath show’d himself; but, madam, right makes room Where weapons want; and, though a many friends Are made away, as Warwick, Lancaster, And others of our party and faction; Yet have we friends, assure your grace, in England Would cast up caps, and clap their hands for joy, To see us there, appointed’ for our foes. Kent. Would all were well, and Edward well reclaim’d, For England’s honour, peace, and quietness. Y. Mor. But by the sword, my lord, ’t must be deserv’d;° The king will ne’er forsake his flatterers. Sir. ]. My lord of England, sith th’ ungentle king Of France refuseth to give aid of arms To this distressed queen his sister here, Go you with her to Hainault. Doubt ye not, We will find comfort, money, men, and friends Ere long, to bid the English king a base.* How say, young prince? What think you of the match? P. Edw. I think King Edward will outrun us all. Q. Isab. Nay, son, not so; and you must not discourage Your friends, that are so forward in your aid. Kent. Sir John of Hainault, pardon us, I pray; These comforts that you give our woful queen Bind us in kindness all at your command. 1If, 2Equipped. 3Earned. 4Challenge. A reference to the game of prisoner’s base.

EDWARD THE SECOND 59 Q. Isab. Yea, gentle brother; and the God of heaven Prosper your happy motion, good Sir John. Y. Mor. This noble gentleman, forward in arms, Was born, I see, to be our anchor-hold. Sir John of Hainault, be it thy renown, That England’s queen and nobles in distress, Have been by thee restor’d and comforted. Sir J. Madam, along, and you my lords, with me, That England’s peers may Hainault’s welcome see. [Exeunt. | [Scene IT] Enter Kinc Epwarp, ArunpeL, the Elder and Younger Spencer, and others K. Edw. Thus after many threats of wrathful war, Triumpheth England’s Edward with his friends; And triumph, Edward, with his friends uncontroll’d! My lord of Gloucester, do you hear the news? Y. Spen. What news, my lord? K. Edw. Why, man, they say there is great execution Done through the realm; my lord of Arundel, You have the note, have you not? Arun. From the Lieutenant of the Tower, my lord. K. Edw. I pray let us see it. [Takes the note.] What have we there? Read it, Spencer. [Hands the note to| Young SPENcER, [who] reads the names. Why, so; they bark’d apace a month ago: Now, on my life, they'll neither bark nor bite. Now, sirs, the news from France? Gloucester, I trow The lords of France love England’s gold so well As Isabella gets no aid from thence. What now remains? Have you proclaim’d, my lord, Reward for them can bring in Mortimer? Y. Spen. My lord, we have; and if he be in England, ’A will be had ere long, I doubt it not.

60 MARLOWE K. Edw. If, dost thou say? Spencer, as true as death, He is in England’s ground; our portmasters Are not so careless of their king’s command. Enter a Messenger How now, what news with thee? From whence come these? Mess. Letters, my lord, and tidings forth of France;— To you, my lord of Gloucester, from Levune. [ Gives letters to Young SPENCER. | K. Edw. Read. Y. Spen. (reads). “My duty to your honour premised, &c., I have, according to instructions in that behalf, dealt with the King of France his lords, and effected that the queen, all discontented and discomforted, is gone: whither, if you ask, with Sir John of Hainault, brother to the marquis, into Flanders. With them are gone Lord Edmund, and the Lord Mortimer, having in their company divers of your nation, and others; and, as constant report goeth, they intend to give King Edward battle in England, sooner than he can look for them. This is all the news of import. __ Your honour’s in all service, Levung.” K. Edw. Ah, villains! hath that Mortimer escap’d? With him is Edmund gone associate? And will Sir John of Hainault lead the round? Welcome, a God’s name, madam, and your son; England shall welcome you and all your rout. Gallop apace, bright Phebus, through the sky, And dusky night, in rusty iron car, Between you both shorten the time, I pray, That I may see that most desired day When we may meet these traitors in the field. Ah, nothing grieves me, but my little boy Is thus misled to countenance their ills. Come, friends, to Bristow,’ there to make us strong; 1 Bristol.

EDWARD THE SECOND 61 And, winds, as equal be to bring them in, As you injurious were to bear them forth! [Exeunt.] [Scene IV. Near Harwich] Enter Queen Isapetta, Prince Epwarp, Kent, Young Mortimer, and Sir Joun or Hainautt Q. Isab. Now, lords, our loving friends and countrymen, Welcome to England all, with prosperous winds! Our kindest friends in Belgia have we left, To cope with friends at home; a heavy case When force to force is knit, and sword and glaive In civil broils make kin and countrymen Slaughter themselves in others, and their sides With their own weapons gore! But what’s the help? Misgoverned kings are cause of all this wrack; And, Edward, thou art one among them all, Whose looseness hath betray’d thy land to spoil, Who made the channels overflow with blood. Of thine own people patron shouldst thou be, But thou—— Y. Mor. Nay, madam, if you be a warrior, You must not grow so passionate in speeches, Lords, Sith that we are by sufferance of Heaven Arriv’d, and armed in this prince’s right, Here for our country’s cause swear we to him All homage, fealty, and forwardness; And for the open wrongs and injuries Edward hath done to us; his queen and land, We come in arms to wreak it with the sword; That England’s queen in peace may repossess Her dignities and honours; and withal We may remove these flatterers from the king, That havoc England’s wealth and treasury.

62 MARLOWE Sir J. Sound trumpets, my lord, and forward let us march. Edward will think we come to flatter him. Kent. I would he never had been flattered more! [Exeunt.} [Scene V. Near Bristol] Enter Kine Epwarp, Batpocx, and Young Spencer, flying about the stage Y. Spen. Fly, fly, my lord! the queen is over-strong; Her friends do multiply, and yours do fail. Shape we our course to Ireland, there to breathe. K. Edw. What! was I born to fly and run away, And leave the Mortimers conquerors behind? Give me my horse, and let’s reinforce our troops: And in this bed of honour die with fame. Bald. O no, my lord, this princely resolution Fits not the time; away! we are pursued. [Exeunt.] Enter Kent, with sword and target Kent. This way he fled, but I am come too late Edward, alas! my heart relents for thee. Proud traitor, Mortimer, why dost thou chase Thy lawful king, thy sovereign, with thy sword? Vile wretch! and why hast thou, of all unkind, Borne arms against thy brother and thy king? Rain showers of vengeance on my cursed head, Thou God, to whom in justice it belongs To punish this unnatural revolt! Edward, this Mortimer aims at thy life! O fly him, then! But, Edmund, calm this rage, Dissemble, or thou diest; for Mortimer And Isabel do kiss, while they conspire; And yet she bears a face of love forsooth. Fie on that love that hatcheth death and hate! Edmund, away! Bristow to Longshanks’ blood Is false. Be not found single for suspect: Proud Mortimer pries near unto thy walks.

EDWARD THE SECOND 63 Enter Quren IsaBetta, Prince Epwarp, Young Mortimer, and Sir JoHN oF Hainaut Q. Isab. Successful battle gives the God of kings To them that fight in right and fear his wrath. Since then successfully we have prevailed, Thanked be Heaven’s great architect, and you. Ere farther we proceed, my noble lords, We here create our well-beloved son, Of love and care unto his royal person, Lord Warden of the realm, and sith the fates Have made his father so infortunate, Deal you, my lords, in this, my loving lords, As to your wisdoms fittest seems in all. Kent. Madam, without offence, if I may ask, How will you deal with Edward in his fall? P. Edw. Tell me, good uncle, what Edward do you mean? Kent. Nephew, your father; I dare not call him king. Y. Mor. My lord of Kent, what needs these questions? *Tis not in her controlment, nor in ours, But as the realm and parliament shall please, So shall your brother be disposed of — I like not this relenting mood in Edmund. Madam, ’tis good to look to him betimes. [Aside to the QuEEN.] Q. Isab. My lord, the Mayor of Bristow knows our mind. Y. Mor. Yea, madam, and they scape not easily That fled the field. QO. Isab Baldock is with the king. A goodly chancellor, is he not, my lord? Sir J. So are the Spencers, the father and the son. Kent. This Edward is the ruin of the realm. Enter Rice av Howe. and the Mayor of Bristow, with the Elder Spencer | prisoner, and Attendants] Rice. God save Queen Isabel, and her princely son! Madam, the mayor and citizens of Bristow, In sign of love and duty to this presence,

64 MARLOWE Present by me this traitor to the state, Spencer, the father to that wanton Spencer, That, like the lawless Catiline of Rome, Revelled in England’s wealth and treasury. QO. Isab. We thank you all. Y. Mor. Your loving care in this Deserveth princely favours and rewards. But where’s the king and the other Spencer fled? Rice. Spencer the son, created Earl of Gloucester, Is with that smooth-tongu’d scholar Baldock gone And shipped but late for Ireland with the king. Y. Mor. Some whirlwind fetch them back or sink them all!— [ Aside. | They shall be started thence, I doubt it not. P, Edw. Shall I not see the king my father yet? Kent. Unhappy’s Edward, chas’d from England’s bounds. [ Aside. | Sir ]. Madam, what resteth, why stand you in a muse? Q. Isab. | rue my lord’s ill-fortune; but alas! Care of my country call’d me to this war. Y. Mor. Madam, have done with care and sad complaint; Your king hath wrong’d your country and himself, And we must seek to right it as we may. Meanwhile, have hence this rebel to the block. Your lordship cannot privilege your head. E. Spen. Rebel is he that fights against his prince; So fought not they that fought in Edward’s right. Y. Mor. Take him away, he prates; [Exeunt Attendants with the Elder Spencer.) You, Rice ap Howell, Shall do good service to her majesty, Being of countenance in your country here, To follow these rebellious runagates. We in meanwhile, madam, must take advice, How Baldock, Spencer, and their complices, May in their fall be followed to their end. Exeunt.

EDWARD THE SECOND [Scenz VI. The scene is in the abbey of Neath] Enter the Abbot, Monks, Kinc Epwarp, Young SPENCER, and Batpock (the three latter disguised) Abbot. Have you no doubt, my lord; have you no fear; As silent and as careful we will be, To keep your royal person safe with us, Free from suspect and fell invasion Of such as have your majesty in chase, Yourself, and those your chosen company, As danger of this stormy time requires. K. Edw. Father, thy face should harbour no deceit. O! hadst thou ever been a king, thy heart, Pierced deeply with sense of my distress, Could not but take compassion of my state. Stately and proud, in riches and in train, Whilom I was, powerful, and full of pomp: But what is he whom rule and empery Have not in life or death made miserable? Come, Spencer; come, Baldock, come, sit down by me; Make trial now of that philosophy, That in our famous nurseries of arts Thou suck’dst from Plato and from Aristotle. Father, this life contemplative is Heaven. O that I might this life in quiet lead! But we, alas! are chas’d; and you, my friends, Your lives and my dishonour they pursue. Yet, gentle monks, for treasure, gold, nor fee, Do you betray us and our company. Monk. Your grace may sit secure, if none but we Do wot of your abode. Y. Spen. Not one alive; but shrewdly I suspect A gloomy fellow in a mead below. ’A gave a long look after us, my lord; And all the land I know is up in arms, Arms that pursue our lives with deadly hate. 65

66 MARLOWE Bald. We were embark’d for Ireland, wretched we! With awkward winds and [with] sore tempests driven To fall on shore, and here to pine in fear Of Mortimer and his confederates. K. Edw. Mortimer! who talks of Mortimer? Who wounds me with the name of Mortimer, That bloody man? Good father, on thy lap Lay I this head, laden with mickle care. O might I never open these eyes again! Never again lift up this drooping head! O never more lift up this dying heart! Y. Spen. Look up, my lord.—Baldock, this drowsiness Betides no good; here even we are betray’d. Enter, with Welsh hooks, Rick ap Howe, a Mower, and LEICESTER Mow. Upon my life, these be the men ye seek. Rice. Fellow, enough.—My lord, I pray be short, A fair commission warrants what we do. Leices. The queen’s commission, urged by Mortimer; What cannot gallant Mortimer with the queen? Alas! see where he sits, and hopes unseen To escape their hands that seek to reave his life. Too true it is, Quem dies vidit veniens superbum, Hune dies vidit fugiens jacentem} But, Leicester, leave to grow so passionate. Spencer and Baldock, by no other names, I do arrest you of high treason here. Stand not on titles, but obey the arrest; *Tis in the name of Isabel the queen. My lord, why droop you thus? K. Edw. O day, the last of all my bliss on earth! Centre of all misfortune! O my stars, Why do you lour unkindly on a king? Comes Leicester, then, in Isabella’s name To take my life, my company from me? 1 Whom the dawn sees proud, evening sees prostrate. Seneca, Thyestes, 613.

EDWARD THE SECOND 67 Here, man, rip up this panting breast of mine, And take my heart in rescue of my friends! Rice. Away with them! Y. Spen. It may become thee yet To let us take our farewell of his grace. Abbot. My heart with pity earns’ to see this sight,— A king to bear these words and proud commands. [ Aside.] K. Edw. Spencer, ah, sweet Spencer, thus then must we part? Y. Spen. We must, my lord, so will the angry Heavens. K. Edw. Nay, so will hell and cruel Mortimer; The gentle Heavens have not to do in this. Bald. My lord, it is in vain to grieve or storm. Here humbly of your grace we take our leaves; Our lots are cast; I fear me, so is thine. K. Edw. In Heaven we may, in earth ne’er shall we meet: And, Leicester, say, what shall become of us? Leices. Your majesty must go to Killingworth? K. Edw. Must! it is somewhat hard, when kings must go. Leices. Here is a litter ready for your grace, That waits your pleasure, and the day grows old. Rice. As good be gone, as stay and be benighted. K. Edw. A litter hast thou? Lay me in a hearse, And to the gates of hell convey me hence; Let Pluto’s bells ring out my fatal knell, And hags howl for my death at Charon’s shore, | For friends hath Edward none but these, And these must die under a tyrant’s sword. Rice. My lord, be going; care not for these, For we shall see them shorter by the heads. K. Edw. Well, that shall be, shall be: part we must! Sweet Spencer, gentle Baldock, part we must! Hence feigned weeds! unfeigned are my woes; [Throws off his disguise.] Father, farewell! Leicester, thou stay’st for me, And goI must. Life, farewell, with my friends. [Exeunt Kinc Epwarp and Leicester. ] 2Yearns. 3 Kenilworth.

68 MARLOWE Y. Spen. O! is he gone? Is noble Edward gone? Parted from hence, never to see us more? Rend, sphere of Heaven! and, fire, forsake thy orb! ’ Earth, melt to air! gone is my sovereign, Gone, gone, alas! never to make return. Bald. Spencer, I see our souls are fleeted hence; We are depriv’d the sunshine of our life: Make for a new life, man; throw up thy eyes, And heart, and hands to Heaven’s immortal throne; Pay nature’s debt with cheerful countenance; Reduce we all our lessons unto this: To die, sweet Spencer, therefore live we all; Spencer, all live to die, and rise to fall. Rice. Come, come, keep these preachments till you come to the place appointed. You, and such as you are, have made wise work in England. Will your lordships away? Mow. Your lordship, I trust, will remember me? Rice. Remember thee, fellow! what else? Follow me to the town. [Exeunt.] [ACT THE FIFTH] [Scenz I. 4 room in Kenilworth Castle] Enter Kinc Epwarp, Leicester, the BisHop of WINCHESTER, [and TrusseL. | Leices. Be patient, good my lord, cease to lament. Imagine Killingworth Castle were your court, And that you lay for pleasure here a space, Not of compulsion or necessity. K. Edw. Leicester, if gentle words might comfort me, Thy speeches long ago had eas’d my sorrows; For kind and loving hast thou always been. The griefs of private men are soon allay’d, But not of kings. The forest deer, being struck, Runs to an herb that closeth up the wounds; But, when the imperial lion’s flesh is gored,

EDWARD THE SECOND He rends and tears it with his wrathful paw, And highly scorning that the lowly earth Should drink his blood, mounts up into the air. And so it fares with me, whose dauntless mind The ambitious Mortimer would seek to curb, And that unnatural queen, false Isabel, That thus hath pent and mew’d me in a prison; For such outrageous passions cloy my soul, As with the wings of rancour and disdain, Full often am I soaring up to Heaven, To plain me to the gods against them both. But when I call to mind I am a king, Methinks I should revenge me of my wrongs, That Mortimer and Isabel have done. But what are kings, when regiment’ is gone, But perfect shadows in a sunshine day? My nobles rule, I bear the name of king; I wear the crown, but am controll’d by them, By Mortimer, and my unconstant queen, Who spots my nuptial bed with infamy; Whilst I am lodg’d within this cave of care, Where sorrow at my elbow still attends, To company my heart with sad laments, That bleeds within me for this strange exchange. But tell me, must I now resign my crown, To make usurping Mortimer a king? B. of Win. Your grace mistakes; it is for England’s good, And princely Edward’s right we crave the crown. K. Edw. No, ’tis for Mortimer, not Edward’s head; For he’s a lamb, encompassed by wolves, Which in a moment will abridge his life. But if proud Mortimer do wear this crown, Heavens turn it to a blaze of quenchless fire! Or like the snaky wreath of Tisiphon, Engirt the temples of his hateful head; So shall not England’s vine be perished, 1 Rule.

70 MARLOWE But Edward’s name survives, though Edward dies. Leices. My lord, why waste you thus the time away? They stay your answer; will you yield your crown? K. Edw. Ah, Leicester, weigh how hardly I can brook To lose my crown and kingdom without cause; To give ambitious Mortimer my right, That like a mountain overwhelms my bliss, In which extreme my mind here murdered is. But what the heavens appoint, I must obey! Here, take my crown; the life of Edward too; [Taking off the crown.] Two kings in England cannot reign at once. But stay awhile, let me be king till night, That I may gaze upon this glittering crown; So shall my eyes receive their last content, My head, the latest honour due to it, And jointly both yield up their wished right. Continue ever thou celestial sun; Let never silent night possess this clime: Stand still you watches of the element; All times and seasons, rest you at a stay, That Edward may be still fair England’s king! But day’s bright beam doth vanish fast away, And needs I must resign my wished crown. Inhuman creatures! nurs’d with tiger’s milk! Why gape you for your sovereign’s overthrow! My diadem I mean, and guiltless life. See, monsters, see, I'll wear my crown again! [He puts on the crown.] What, fear you not the fury of your king? But, hapless Edward, thou art fondly’ led; They pass’ not for thy frowns as late they did, But seek to make a new-elected king; Which fills my mind with strange despairing thoughts, Which thoughts are martyred with endless torments, And in this torment comfort find I none, 2Foolishly. 3 Care.

EDWARD THE SECOND 71 But that I feel the crown upon my head; And therefore let me wear it yet awhile. Trus. My lord, the parliament must have present news, And therefore say, will you resign or no? The Kine rageth. K. Edw. Yl not resign, but whilst I live be king. Traitors, be gone and join with Mortimer! Elect, conspire, install, do what you will:— Their blood and yours shall seal these treacheries! B. of Win, This answer we'll return, and so farewell. [Going with TrRusset.] Leices. Call them again, my lord, and speak them fair; For if they go, the prince shall lose his right. K. Edw. Call thou them back, I have no power to speak. Leices. My lord, the king is willing to resign. B. of Win, If he be not, let him choose. K. Edw. O would I might, but heavens and earth conspire To make me miserable! Here receive my crown; Receive it? No, these innocent hands of mine Shall not be guilty of so foul a crime. He of you all that most desires my blood, And will be called the murderer of a king, Take it. What, are you moved? Pity you me? Then send for unrelenting Mortimer, And Isabel, whose eyes, being turned to steel, Will sooner sparkle fire than shed a tear. Yet stay, for rather than I'll look on them, Here, here! [ Gives the crown.] Now, sweet God of Heaven, Make me despise this transitory pomp, And sit for aye enthronized in Heaven! Come, death, and with thy fingers close my eyes, Or if I live, let me forget myself. B. of Win. My lord— K, Edw. Call me not lord; away—out of my sight! Ah, pardon me: grief makes me lunatic! Let not that Mortimer protect my son; More safety is there in a tiger’s jaws,

72 MARLOWE Than his embracements. Bear this to the queen, Wet with my tears, and dried again with sighs; [Gives a handkerchief. | If with the sight thereof she be not mov’d, : Return it back and dip it in my blood. Commend me to my son, and bid him rule Better than I. Yet how have I transgress’d, Unless it be with too much clemency? Trus. And thus most humbly do we take our leave. K. Edw. Farewell; [Exeunt the Bisuop or WINCHESTER and TrussEL. ] I know the next news that they bring Will be my death; and welcome shall it be; To wretched men, death is felicity. Enter BerKELey, [who gives a paper to Leicester] Leices. Another post! what news brings he? K. Edw. Such news as I expect—come, Berkeley, come, And tell thy message to my naked breast. Berk. My lord, think not a thought so villainous Can harbour in a man of noble birth. To do your highness service and devoir, And save you from your foes, Berkeley would die. Leices. My lord, the council of the queen commands That I resign my charge. K. Edw. And who must keep me now? Must you, my lord? Berk. Ay, my most gracious lord; so ’tis decreed. K. Edw. [taking the paper.| By Mortimer, whose name is written here! Well may I rend his name that rends my heart! [Tears it.] This poor revenge has something eas’d my mind. So may his limbs be torn, as is this paper! Hear me, immortal Jove, and grant it too! Berk. Your grace must hence with me to Berkeley straight. K. Edw. Whither you will; all places are alike, And every earth is fit for burial.

EDWARD THE SECOND 73 Letces. Favour him, my lord, as much as lieth in you. Berk. Even so betide my soul as I use him. K. Edw. Mine enemy hath pitied my estate, And that’s the cause that I am now remov'd. Berk. And thinks your grace that Berkeley will be cruel? K. Edw. Uknow not; but of this am I assured, That death ends all, and I can die but once. Leicester, farewell! Leices. Not yet, my lord; I'll bear you on your way. Exeunt. [Scene II. The royal palace] Enter Queen Isapetta and Young Mortimer Y. Mor. Fair Isabel, now have we our desire; The proud corrupters of the light-brain’d king Have done their homage to the lofty gallows, And he himself lies in captivity. Be rul’d by me, and we will rule the realm. In any case take heed of childish fear, For now we hold an old wolf by the ears, That, if he slip, will seize upon us both, And gripe the sorer, being grip’d himself. Think therefore, madam, that imports us much To erect your son with all the speed we may, And that I be protector over him; For our behoof will bear the greater sway Whenas a king’s name shall be under writ. Q. Isab. Sweet Mortimer, the life of Isabel, Be thou persuaded that I love thee well, And therefore, so the prince my son be safe, Whom I esteem as dear as these mine eyes, Conclude against his father what thou wilt, And I myself will willingly subscribe. Y. Mor. First would I hear news that he were depos’d, And then let me alone to handle him.

74 MARLOWE Enter MEss—ENGER Letters! from whence? Mess. From Killingworth, my lord. Q. Isab. How fares my lord the king? Mess. In health, madam, but full of pensiveness. Q. Isab. Alas, poor soul, would I could ease his grief! [Enter the Bisnor oF WINCHESTER with the crown.] Thanks, gentle Winchester. [To the Messenger. | Sirrah, be gone. | Exit Messenger. | B. of Win. The king hath willingly resign’d his crown. Q. Isab. O happy news! send for the prince, my son. B. of Win, Further, or this letter was seal’d, Lord Berkeley came, So that he now is gone from Killingworth; And we have heard that Edmund laid a plot To set his brother free; no more but so. The lord of Berkeley is as pitiful As Leicester that had charge of him before. Q. Isab. Then let some other be his guardian. Y. Mor. Let me alone, here is the privy seal. [Exit the Bishop or WIncHESTER. | Who’s there?—Call hither Gurney and Matrevis. . [To Attendants within.| To dash the heavy-headed Edmund’s drift, Berkeley shall be discharg’d, the king remov’d, And none but we shall know where he lieth. QO. Isab. But, Mortimer, as long as he survives, What safety rests for us, or for my son? Y. Mor. Speak, shall he presently be despatch’d and die? Q. Isab. 1 would he were, so *twere not by my means. Enter Matrevis and GuRNEY Y. Mor. Enough.— Matrevis, write a letter presently Unto the lord of Berkeley from ourself That he resign the king to thee and Gurney; And when ’tis done, we will subscribe our name.

EDWARD THE SECOND 75 Maz. It shall be done, my lord. [ Writes.] Y. Mor. Gurney. Gur. My lord. Y. Mor. As thou intend’st to rise by Mortimer, Who now makes Fortune’s wheel turn as he please, Seek all the means thou canst to make him droop, And neither give him kind word nor good look. Gur. I warrant you, my lord. Y. Mor. And this above the rest: because we hear That Edmund casts’ to work his liberty, Remove him still from place to place by night, Till at the last he come to Killingworth, And then from thence to Berkeley back again; And by the way, to make him fret the more, Speak curstly to him, and in any case Let no man comfort him; if he chance to weep, But amplify his grief with bitter words. Mat. Fear not, my lord, we'll do as you command. Y. Mor. So now away; post thitherwards amain. Q.Isab. Whither goes this letter? To my lord the king? Commend me humbly to his majesty, And tell him that I labour all in vain To ease his grief, and work his liberty; And bear him this as witness of my love. [Gives a ring.] Mat. I will, madam. Exit with GuRNEyY. Enter Prince Epwaro, and Kent talking with him Y. Mor. Finely dissembled. Do so still, sweet queen. Here comes the young prince with the Earl of Kent. Q. Isab. Something he whispers in his childish ears. Y. Mor. If he have such access unto the prince, Our plots and stratagems will soon be dash’d. Q. Isab, Use Edmund friendly, as if all were well. Y. Mor. How fares my honourable lord of Kent? Kent. In health, sweet Mortimer. How fares your grace? Q. Isab. Well, if my lord your brother were enlarg’d. 1 Plots.

76 MARLOWE Kent. I hear of late he hath depos’d himself. QO. Isab. The more my grief. Y. Mor. And mine. Kent. Ah, they do dissemble! [ Aside.] Q. Isab. Sweet son, come hither, I must talk with thee. Y. Mor. You being his uncle, and the next of blood, Do look to be protector o’er the prince. Kent. Not I, my lord; who should protect the son, But she that gave him life? I mean the queen. P. Edw. Mother, persuade me not to wear the crown: Let him be king—I am too young to reign. Q. Isab. But be content, seeing ’tis his highness’ pleasure. P. Edw. Let me but see him first, and then I will. Kent. Ay, do, sweet nephew. Q. Isab. Brother, you know it is impossible. P, Edw. Why, is he dead? Q. Isab. No, God forbid! Kent. 1 would those words proceeded from your heart. Y. Mor. Inconstant Edmund, dost thou favour him, That wast the cause of his imprisonment? Kent. The more cause have I now to make amends. Y. Mor, [Aside to Q. Isas.] I tell thee, tis not meet that one so false Should come about the person of a prince — My lord, he hath betray’d the king his brother, And therefore trust him not. P. Edw. But he repents, and sorrows for it now. Q. Isab. Come, son, and go with this gentle lord and me. P, Edw. With you I will, but not with Mortimer. Y. Mor. Why, youngling, ’sdain’st thou so of Mortimer? Then I will carry thee by force away. P, Edw. Help, uncle Kent! Mortimer will wrong me. Q. Isab. Brother Edmund, strive not; we are his friends; Isabel is nearer than the Earl of Kent. Kent. Sister, Edward is my charge, redeem him. Q. Isab, Edward is my son, and I will keep him. Kent. Mortimer shall know that he hath wrong’d me!— Hence will I haste to Killingworth Castle,

EDWARD THE SECOND 77 And rescue aged Edward from his foes, To be reveng’d on Mortimer and thee. [ Aside.] Exeunt [on one side QuéEEN IsaBELLa, Prince Epwarp, and Young Mortimer; on the other Kenr.] [Scene III. Kenilworth Castle] Enter Marrevis and Gurney [and Soldiers,] with Kine Epwarp Mat. My lord, be not pensive, we are your friends; Men are ordain’d to live in misery, Therefore come,—dalliance dangereth our lives. K. Edw. Friends, whither must unhappy Edward go? Will hateful Mortimer appoint no rest? Must I be vexed like the nightly bird, Whose sight is loathsome to all winged fowls? When will the fury of his mind assuage? When will his heart be satisfied with blood? If mine will serve, unbowel straight this breast, And give my heart to Isabel and him; It is the chiefest mark they level at. Gur, Not so my liege, the queen hath given this charge To keep your grace in safety; Your passions make your dolours to increase. K. Edw. This usage makes my misery to increase. But can my air of life continue long When all my senses are annoy’d with stench? Within a dungeon England’s king is kept, Where I am starv’d for want of sustenance. My daily diet is heart-breaking sobs, That almost rents the closet of my heart. Thus lives old Edward not reliev’d by any, And so must die, though pitied by many. O, water, gentle friends, to cool my thirst, And clear my body from foul excrements! Mat. Here’s channel’ water, as our charge is given. Sit down, for we'll be barbers to your grace. 1 Gutter.

78 MARLOWE K. Edw. Traitors, away! What, will you murder me, Or choke your sovereign with puddle water? Gur. No; but wash your face, and shave away your beard, Lest you be known and so be rescued. Mat. Why strive you thus? Your labour is in vain! K. Edw. ‘The wren may strive against the lion’s strength, But all in vain: so vainly do I strive To seek for mercy at a tyrant’s hand. They wash him with puddle water, and shave his beard away. Immortal powers! that knows the painful cares That wait upon my poor distressed soul, O level all your looks upon these daring men, That wrongs their liege and sovereign, England’s king! O Gaveston, ’tis for thee that I am wrong’d, For me, both thou and both the Spencers died! And for your sakes a thousand wrongs I'll take. The Spencers’ ghosts, wherever they remain, Wish well to mine; then tush, for them I'll die. Mat. ’Twixt theirs and yours shall be no enmity. Come, come away; now put the torches out, We'll enter in by darkness to Killingworth. Enter Kent Gur. How now, who comes there? Mat. Guard the king sure: it is the Earl of Kent. K. Edw. O gentle brother, help to rescue me! Mat. Keep them asunder; thrust in the king. Kent. Soldiers, let me but talk to him one word. Gur, Lay hands upon the earl for his assault. Kent. Lay down your weapons, traitors! Yield the king! Mat. Edmund, yield thou thyself, or thou shalt die. Kent. Base villains, wherefore do you gripe me thus? Gur. Bind him and so convey him to the court. Kent. Where is the court but here? Here is the king; And I will visit him; why stay you me?

EDWARD THE SECOND 79 Mat. The court is where Lord Mortimer remains; Thither shall your honour go; and so farewell. Exeunt Martrevis and Gurney, with Kinc Epwarp. Kent. O miserable is that commonweal, Where lords keep courts, and kings are locked in prison! Sol. Wherefore stay we? On, sirs, to the court! Kent. Ay, lead me whither you will, even to my death, Seeing that my brother cannot be releas’d. Exeunt. [Scene IV. The royal palace | Enter Young Mortimer Y. Mor. The king must die, or Mortimer goes down; The commons now begin to pity him. Yet he that is the cause of Edward’s death, Is sure to pay for it when his son’s of age; And therefore will I do it cunningly. This letter, written by a friend of ours, Contains his death, yet bids them save his life. [Reads.] “Edwardum occidere nolite timere, bonum est Fear not to kill the king, ’tis good he die.” But read it thus, and that’s another sense: “Edwardum occidere nolite, timere bonum est Kill not the king, ’tis good to fear the worst.” Unpointed as it is, thus shall it go, That, being dead, if it chance to be found, Matrevis and the rest may bear the blame, And we be quit that caus’d it to be done. Within this room is lock’d the messenger That shall convey it, and perform the rest; And by a secret token that he bears, Shall he be murdered when the deed is done — Lightborn, come forth! Enter Licutsorn Art thou as resolute as thou wast? Light. What else, my lord? And far more resolute.

80 MARLOWE Y. Mor. And hast thou cast’ how to accomplish it? Light. Ay, ay, and none shall know which way he died. Y. Mor, But at his looks, Lightborn, thou wilt relent. Light. Relent! ha, ha! I use much to relent. Y. Mor. Well, do it bravely, and be secret. Light. You shall not need to give instructions; *Tis not the first time I have kill’d a man. I learn’d in Naples how to poison flowers; To strangle with a lawn thrust through the throat; To pierce the windpipe with a needle’s point; Or whilst one is asleep, to take a quill And blow a little powder in his ears; Or open his mouth and pour quicksilver down. And yet I have a braver way than these. Y. Mor. Whiat’s that? Light. Nay, you shall pardon me; none shall know my tricks. Y. Mor. I care not how it is, so it be not spied. Deliver this to Gurney and Matrevis. [Gives letter.] At every ten mile end thou hast a horse. Take this; [Gives money] away! and never see me more. Light. No! , Y. Mor. No; Unless thou bring me news of Edward’s death. Light. That will I quickly do. Farewell, my lord. [Exit.] Y. Mor. The prince I rule, the queen do I command, And with a lowly congé to the ground, The proudest lords salute me as I pass; I seal, I cancel, I do what I will. Fear’d am I more than lov’d;—let me be fear’d, And when I frown, make all the court look pale. I view the prince with Aristarchus’ eyes, Whose looks were as a breeching to a boy. They thrust upon me the protectorship, And sue to me for that that I desire. While at the council-table, grave enough, And not unlike a bashful puritan, 1 Planned.

EDWARD THE SECOND 81 First I complain of imbecility, Saying it is onus quam gravissimum,? Till being interrupted by my friends, Suscepi that provinciam® as they term it; And to conclude, I am Protector now. Now is all sure: the queen and Mortimer Shall rule the realm, the king; and none rule us. Mine enemies will I plague, my friends advance; And what I list command who dare control? Major sum quam cui possit fortuna nocere. And that this be the coronation-day, It pleaseth me, and Isabel the queen. [Trumpets within.] The trumpets sound, I must go take my place. Enter the Young Kine, Queen IsaBetia, the ARCHBISHOP oF CanterBury, Champion and Nobles A. of Cant. Long live King Edward, by the grace of God King of England and Lord of Ireland! Cham. If any Christian, Heathen, Turk, or Jew, Dares but affirm that Edward’s not true king, And will avouch his saying with the sword, I am the champion that will combat him. Y. Mor. None comes, sound trumpets. [Trumpets sound.] K. Edw. Third. Champion, here’s to thee. [Gives a purse.| Q. Isab, Lord Mortimer, now take him to your charge. Enter Soldiers, with Kent prisoner Y. Mor. What traitor have we there with blades and bills? Sol. Edmund, the Earl of Kent. K. Edw. Third. What hath he done? Sol.’A would have taken the king away perforce, As we were bringing him to Killingworth. Y. Mor. Did you attempt this rescue, Edmund? Speak. 24 very heavy burden. 31 have undertaken that office. ‘41 am too great for fortune to injure. Ovid, Metam. vi. 195.

82 MARLOWE Kent. Mortimer, I did; he is our king, And thou compell’st this prince to wear the crown. Y. Mor. Strike off his head! he shall have martial law. Kent. Strike off my head! Base traitor, I defy thee! K. Edw. Third. My lord, he is my uncle, and shall live. Y. Mor. My lord, he is your enemy, and shall die. Kent. Stay, villains! K. Edw. Third. Sweet mother, if I cannot pardon him, Entreat my Lord Protector for his life. Q. Isab. Son, be content; I dare not speak a word. K. Edw. Third. Nor I, and yet methinks I should command; But, seeing I cannot, I'll entreat for him— My lord, if you will let my uncle live, I will requite it when I come to age. Y. Mor. ’Tis for your highness’ good, and for the realm’s.— How often shall I bid you bear him hence? Kent. Art thou king? Must I die at thy command? Y. Mor. At our command—Once more away with him. Kent. Let me but stay and speak; I will not go. Either my brother or his son is king, And none of both them thirst for Edmund’s blood: And therefore, soldiers, whither will you hale me? Soldiers hale Kent away, to be beheaded. K. Edw. Third. What safety may I look for at his hands, If that my uncle shall be murdered thus? Q. Isab, Fear not, sweet boy, I'll guard thee from thy foes; Had Edmund lived, he would have sought thy death. Come, son, we'll ride a-hunting in the park. K. Edw. Third. And shall my uncle Edmund ride with us? Q. Isab. He is a traitor; think not on him; come. Exeunt. [Scene V. Berkeley Castle] Enter Matrevis and GuRNEY Mat. Gurney, I wonder the king dies not, Being in a vault up to the knees in water, To which the channels of the castle run,

EDWARD THE SECOND 83 From whence a damp continually ariseth, That were enough to poison any man, Much more a king brought up so tenderly. Gur. And so do I, Matrevis: yesternight I opened but the door to throw him meat, And I was almost stifled with the savour. Mat. He hath a body able to endure More than we can inflict: and therefore now Let us assail his mind another while. Gur. Send for him out thence, and I will anger him. Mat. But stay, who’s this? Enter LicutBorn Light. My Lord Protector greets you. [Gives letter.] Gur. What’s here? I know not how to construe it. Mat. Gurney, it was left unpointed for the nonce; “Edwardum occidere nolite timere,”’ That’s his meaning. Light. Know ye this token? I must have the king. [Gives token.] Mat. Ay, stay awhile, thou shalt have answer straight. This villain’s sent to make away the king. [ Aside.] Gur. I thought as much. [ Aside. | Mat. And when the murder’s done, See how he must be handled for his labour. Pereat iste!’ Let him have the king. [Aside.] What else? Here is the key, this is the lake,” Do as you are commanded by my lord. Light. | know what I must do. Get you away. Yet be not far off, I shall need your help; See that in the next room I have a fire, And get me a spit, and let it be red-hot. Mat. Very well. Gur. Need you anything besides? Light. What else? A table and a feather-bed. Gur. That’s all? 1 Let this man die. * Perhaps for “lock.”

84 MARLOWE Light. Ay, ay; so, when I call you, bring it in. Mat. Fear not thou that. Gur. Here’s a light, to go into the dungeon. [ Gives alight, and then exit with Matrevis.} Light. So now Must I about this gear; ne’er was there any So finely handled as this king shall be. For, here’s a place indeed, with all my heart! K. Edw. Who's there? What light is that? wherefore com’st thou? Light. To comfort you, and bring you joyful news. K. Edw. Small comfort finds poor Edward in thy looks. Villain, I know thou com’st to murder me. Light. To murder you, my most gracious lord! Far is it from my heart to do you harm. The queen sent me to see how you were used, For she relents at this your misery: And what eyes can refrain from shedding tears, To see a king in this most piteous state? K, Edw. Weep’st thou already? List awhile to me And then thy heart, were it as Gurney’s is, Or as Matrevis’, hewn from the Caucasus, Yet will it melt, ere I have done my tale. This dungeon where they keep me is the sink Wherein the filth of all the castle falls. Light. O villains! K. Edw. And there in mire and puddle have I stood This ten days’ space; and, lest that I should sleep, One plays continually upon a drum. They give me bread and water, being a king; So that, for want of sleep and sustenance, My mind’s distempered, and my body’s numb’d, And whether I have limbs or no I know not. O, would my blood dropp’d out from every vein, As doth this water from my tattered robes. Tell Isabel, the queen, I look’d not thus, 3 Business.

EDWARD THE SECOND 85 When for her sake I ran at tilt in France, And there unhors’d the Duke of Cleremont. Light. O speak no more, my lord! this breaks my heart. Lie on this bed, and rest yourself awhile. K. Edw. These looks of thine can harbour nought but death: I see my tragedy written in thy brows. Yet stay a while; forbear thy bloody hand, And let me see the stroke before it comes, That even then when I shall lose my life, My mind may be more steadfast on my God. Light. What means your highness to mistrust me thus? K. Edw, What mean’st thou to dissemble with me thus? Light. These hands were never stain’d with innocent blood, Nor shall they now be tainted with a king’s. K. Edw. Forgive my thought for having such a thought. One jewel have I left; receive thou this. [Giving jewel.] Still fear I, and I know not what’s the cause, But every joint shakes as I give it thee. O, if thou harbour’st murder in thy heart, Let this gift change thy mind, and save thy soul! Know that I am a king: O, at that name I feel a hell of grief! Where is my crown? Gone, gone! and do I still remain alive? Light. You're overwatch’d, my lord; lie down and rest. K. Edw. But that grief keeps me waking, I should sleep; For not these ten days have these eye-lids clos’d. Now as I speak they fall, and yet with fear Open again. O wherefore sitt’st thou here? Light. If you mistrust me, I’ll begone, my lord. K. Edw, No, no, for if thou mean’st to murder me, Thou wilt return again, and therefore stay. [ Sleeps. | Light. He sleeps. K. Edw. [waking]. O let me not die yet! O stay a while! Light. How now, my lord? K. Edw. Something still buzzeth in mine ears, And tells me if I sleep I never wake; This fear is that which makes me tremble thus.

86 MARLOWE And therefore tell me, wherefore art thou come? Light. To rid thee of thy life—Matrevis, come! Enter Matrevis and GuRNEY K. Edw. 1 am too weak and feeble to resist:— Assist me, sweet God, and receive my soul! Light. Run for the table. K. Edw. O spare me, or despatch me in a trice. [Marrevis brings in a table.] Light. So, lay the table down, and stamp on it, But not too hard, lest that you bruise his body. [Kine Epwarp ts murdered.]| Mat. I fear me that this cry will raise the town, And therefore, let us take horse and away. Light. Tell me, sirs, was it not bravely done? Gur. Excellent well: take this for thy reward. Gurney stabs Licursorn [who dies.] Come, let us cast the body in the moat, And bear the king’s to Mortimer our lord: Away! Exeunt [with the bodies.| [Scene VI. The royal palace, London] Enter Young Mortimer and Matrevis Y. Mor. Is’t done, Matrevis, and the murderer dead? Mat. Ay, my good lord; I would it were undone! Y. Mor. Matrevis, if thou now growest penitent I'll be thy ghostly father; therefore choose, Whether thou wilt be secret in this, Or else die by the hand of Mortimer. Mat. Gurney, my lord, is fled, and will, I fear Betray us both, therefore let me fly. Y. Mor. Fly to the savages! Mat. 1 humbly thank your honour. [Exit.] Y. Mor. As for myself, I stand as Jove’s huge tree, And others are but shrubs compar’d to me. All tremble at my name, and I fear none; Let’s see who dare impeach me for his death!

EDWARD THE SECOND Enter Queen IsABELLA Q. Isab. Ah, Mortimer, the king my son hath news His father’s dead, and we have murdered him! Y. Mor. What if he have? The king is yet a child. Q. Isab. Ay, but he tears his hair, and wrings his hands, And vows to be reveng’d upon us both. Into the council-chamber he is gone, To crave the aid and succour of his peers. Ay me! see here he comes, and they with him. Now, Mortimer, begins our tragedy. Enter Kinc Epwarp tHe Turn, Lorps, and Attendants. 1st Lord. Fear not, my lord, know that you are a king. K. Edw. Third. Villain!— Y. Mor. How now, my lord! K. Edw. Third. Think not that I am frighted with thy words! My father’s murdered through thy treachery; And thou shalt die, and on his mournful hearse Thy hateful and accursed head shall lie, To witness to the world, that by thy means His kingly body was too soon interr’d. Q. Isab. Weep not, sweet son! K. Edw. Third. Forbid me not to weep; he was my father; And, had you lov’d him half so well as I, You could not bear his death thus patiently. But you, I fear, conspir’d with Mortimer. 1st Lord. Why speak you not unto my lord the king? Y. Mor. Because I think scorn to be accus’d. Who is the man dares say I murdered him? K. Edw. Third, ‘Traitor! in me my loving father speaks, And plainly saith, twas thou that murd’redst him. Y. Mor. But has your grace no other proof than this? K. Edw. Third. Yes, if this be the hand of Mortimer. 87 [Shewing letter.] Y. Mor. False Gurney hath betray’d me and himself. —[ Aside.] Q. Isab. I fear’d as much; murder cannot be hid. [Aside.]

88 MARLOWE Y. Mor. It is my hand; what gather you by this? K. Edw. Third, That thither thou didst send a murderer. Y. Mor. What murderer? Bring forth the man I sent. K. Edw. Third. Ah, Mortimer, thou knowest that he is slain; And so shalt thou be too—Why stays he here Bring him unto a hurdle, drag him forth; Hang him, I say, and set his quarters up; But bring his head back presently to me. Q. Isab. For my sake, sweet son, pity Mortimer! Y. Mor. Madam, entreat not, I will rather die, Than sue for life unto a paltry boy. K. Edw. Third. Hence with the traitor! with the murderer! Y. Mor. Base Fortune, now I see, that in thy wheel There is a point, to which when men aspire, They tumble headlong down: that point I touch’d, And, seeing there was no place to mount up higher, Why should I grieve at my declining fall?— Farewell, fair queen; weep not for Mortimer, That scorns the world, and, as a traveller, Goes to discover countries yet unknown. K. Edw. Third. What! suffer you the traitor to delay? [Young Mortmer is taken away by First Lord and Attendants. } Q. Isab, As thou receivedest thy life from me, Spill not the blood of gentle Mortimer! K. Edw. Third. This argues that you spilt my father’s blood, Else would you not entreat for Mortimer. Q. Isab. 1 spill his blood? No. K. Edw. Third. Ay, madam, you; for so the rumour runs. Q. Isab. That rumour is untrue; for loving thee, Is this report rais’d on poor Isabel. K. Edw. Third. 1 do not think her so unnatural. 2nd Lord. My lord, I fear me it will prove too true. K. Edw. Third. Mother, you are suspected for his death And therefore we commit you to the Tower Till farther trial may be made thereof; If you be guilty, though I be your son,

EDWARD THE SECOND 89 Think not to find me slack or pitiful. Q. Isab. Nay, to my death, for too long have I liv’d Whenas my son thinks to abridge my days. K. Edw. Third. Away with her, her words enforce these tears, And I shall pity her if she speak again. Q. Isab. Shall I not mourn for my beloved lord, And with the rest accompany him to his grave? 2nd Lord. Thus, madam, ’tis the king’s will you shall hence. Q. Isab. He hath forgotten me; stay, I am his mother. 2nd Lord. That boots not; therefore, gentle madam, go. Q. Isab. Then come, sweet death, and rid me of this grief. [Exit.] [Re-enter 1st Lord, with the head of Young Mortimer] 1st Lord. My lord, here is the head of Mortimer. K. Edw. Third. Go fetch my father’s hearse, where it shall lie; And bring my funeral robes. [Exeunt Attendants. ] Accursed head, Could I have rul’d thee then, as I do now, Thou had’st not hatch’d this monstrous treachery!— Here comes the hearse; help me to mourn, my lords. [Re-enter Attendants with the hearse and funeral robes] Sweet father, here unto thy murdered ghost I offer up this wicked traitor’s head; And let these tears, distilling from mine eyes, Be witness of my grief and innocency. [Exeunt.]

THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET PRINCE OF DENMARK BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE

INTRODUCTORY NOTE Tue tragedy of “Hamlet,” the most renowned of English dramas, is based on a legend found in the “History of the Danes,” written by Saxo Grammaticus about 1200. It came to England through the French, and was already on the stage in a version now lost, before Shakespeare took it up. The earliest edition of our play was printed in a corrupt form in 1603, and was written at least as early as 1602. A more correct edition appeared in 1604, and further alterations appeared in the version printed in the first collected edition of Shakespeare’s plays in 1623. The author seems to have worked over and revised this tragedy more than any other of his dramas. The main situation of the tragedy goes back to the prose tale. There we have a king murdered by his brother, who had previously seduced and has now married the queen; and the son of the king, aiming at revenge, finally achieving it, and using the device of pretended madness to protect himself in the meantime. The prototype of Polonius is killed while eavesdropping, but his character bears little resemblance to Shakespeare’s Lord Chamberlain; Ophelia and Horatio are merely hinted at; while Laertes, Fortinbras, and several of the minor characters, such as the grave-diggers and Osric, are altogether absent. The original Hamlet goes to England without interruption from pirates, witnesses the death of his two companions, returns and kills not only the king, but all his courtiers, goes to England again and marries two wives, one of whom betrays him to his. death. Other elements of the tragedy that are probably not due to Shakespeare’s invention have been gathered from a study of contemporary “tragedies of revenge.” How many of such additions were made by Shakespeare, how many by the author of the lost play, cannot be decided. But for those things which have raised “Hamlet” to its preeminent position in the history of literature—the magnificence of the poetry, the amazing truth and subtlety of the psychology, and the intensity of the tragic emotion, it is not hard to assign the credit.

Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour. Ber, ’Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco. Fran. For this relief much thanks. ’Tis bitter cold, And I am sick at heart. 93

94 SHAKESPEARE Ber. Have you had quiet guard? Fran. Not a mouse stirring. Ber. Well, good-night. If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, The rivals’ of my watch, bid them make haste. Enter Horatio and Marce.ius Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there? Hor. Friends to this ground. Mar. And liegemen to the Dane. Fran. Give you good-night. Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier. Who hath reliev’d you? Fran. Bernardo has my place. Give you good-night. Mar. Holla! Bernardo! Ber. Say, What, is Horatio there? Hor. A piece of him. Ber. Welcome, Horatio; welcome, good Marcellus. Hor. What, has this thing appear’d again to-night? Ber. I have seen nothing. Mar. Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy, And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us; Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night, That if again this apparition come, He may approve our eyes and speak to it. Hor. Tush, tush, ’twill not appear. Ber. Sit down a while, And let us once again assail your ears, That are so fortified against our story, What we two nights have seen. Hor. Well, sit we down, And let us hear Bernardo speak of this. 1 Partners. Exit.

HAMLET 95 Ber. Last night of all, When yond same star that’s westward from the pole Had made his course to illume that part of heaven Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, The bell then beating one,— Enter Ghost Mar. Peace, break thee off! Look, where it comes again! Ber, In the same figure, like the king that’s dead. Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio. Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio. Hor. Most like; it harrows me with fear and wonder. Ber. It would be spoke to. Mar. Question it, Horatio. Hor. What art thou that usurp’st this time of night, Together with that fair and warlike form In which the majesty of buried Denmark Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee, speak! Mar. It is offended. , Ber. See, it stalks away! Hor. Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak! Exit Ghost. Mar. ’Tis gone, and will not answer. Ber. How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale. Is not this something more than fantasy? What think you on ’t? Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe Without the sensible’ and true avouch* Of mine own eyes. Mar. Is it not like the King? Hor. As thou art to thyself. Such was the very armour he had on When he the ambitious Norway combated. So frown’d he once, when, in an angry parle, He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. *Tis strange. 2 Appealing to the senses. 3 Evidence.

96 SHAKESPEARE Mar. Thus twice before, and jump‘ at this dead hour, With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch. Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not; But, in the gross and scope® of my opinion, This bodes some strange eruption to our state. Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows, Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land, And why such daily cast of brazen cannon, And foreign mart for implements of war; Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week. What might be toward, that this sweaty haste Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day, Who is’t that can inform me? Hor. That can I; At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, Whose image even but now appear’d to us, Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, Thereto prick’d on by a most emulate pride, Dar’d to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet— For so this side of our known world esteem’d him— Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal’d compact, Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands Which he stood seiz’d of,’ to the conqueror; Against the which, a moiety competent Was gaged’ by our king; which had return’d To the inheritance of Fortinbras, Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant, And carriage of the article design’d,® His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle hot and full, Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there Shark’d up’ a list of landless resolutes, 4Precisely. 5 General view. 5 Possessed of. 7?Pledged. 8 Tenor of the agreement. 9% Gathered in.

HAMLET For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomach” in ’t; which is no other— As it doth well appear unto our state— But to recover of us, by strong hand And terms compulsative,” those foresaid lands So by his father lost; and this, I take it, Is the main motive of our preparations, The source of this our watch, and the chief head Of this post-haste and romage”™ in the land. [Ber. I think it be no other but e’en so. Well may it sort’ that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch, so like the King That was and is the question of these wars. Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye. In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets. As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun; and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. And even the like precurse of fierce events, As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climatures’® and countrymen. | Re-enter Ghost But soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again! T'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!

Shall I strike at it with my partisan?” Hor. Do, if it will not stand. Ber. ’Tis here! Hor. ’Tis here! Mar. "Tis gone! Exit Ghost. We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer it the show of violence; For it is, as the air, invulnerable, And our vain blows malicious mockery. Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew. Hor. And then it started. like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons. I have heard, The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat Awake the god of day; and, at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, The extravagant” and erring” spirit hies To his confine; and of the truth herein This present object made probation. Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock. Some say that ever ’gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated, The bird of dawning singeth all night long; And then, they say, no spirit can walk abroad; The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,” No fairy takes,’° nor witch hath power to charm, So hallow’d and so gracious is the time. 16 Halberd. 17 Wandering beyond bounds. 18 Exert evil influence. 1% Charms.

Break we our watch up; and, by my advice, Let us impart what we have seen to-night Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty? Mar. Let’s do ’t, I pray; and I this morning know Where we shall find him most conveniently. Exeunt. [Scene II. 4 room of state in the castle] Flourish, Enter the Kinc, Queen, HaMtet, Potonius, Laerres, Opue.ia, Lords, and Attendants King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death The memory be green, and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe, Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him Together with remembrance of ourselves. Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, The imperial jointress of this warlike state, Have we, as ’twere with a defeated’ joy,— With one auspicious and one dropping eye, With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and dole,— Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr’d Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone With this affair along. For all, our thanks. Now follows that you know: young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brother’s death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, 1 Disfigured.

I00 SHAKESPEARE Colleagued with the dream of his advantage, He hath not fail’d to pester us with message Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bonds of law, To our most valiant brother. So much for him. Enter VottTiManp and CoRNELIUS Now for ourself and for this time of meeting, Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,— Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew’s purpose,—to suppress His further gait” herein, in that the levies, The lists and full proportions, are all made Out of his subject;? and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norway; Giving to you no further personal power To business with the king, more than the scope Of these delated* articles allow. [ Giving a paper. Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty. [Cor. Vol. King. We doubt it nothing; heartily farewell. Exeunt Vottimanp and Cornegtius. And now, Laertes, what’s the news with you? You told us of some suit; what is ’t, Laertes? You cannot speak of reason to the Dane, And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes, That shall not be my offer, not thy asking? The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. What wouldst thou have, Laertes? Laer. Dread my lord, Your leave and favour to return to France; 2Progress. %People. 4 Offered. \ In that and all things will we show our duty.

HAMLET IOI From whence though willingly I came to Denmark To show my duty in your coronation, Yet now, I must confess, that duty done, My thoughts and wishes bend again towards France And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon. King. Have you your father’s leave? What says Polonius? Pol. He hath, my lord, [wrung from me my slow leave By laboursome petition, and at last Upon his will I seal’d my hard consent.] I do beseech you, give him leave to go. King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine, And thy best graces spend it at thy will! But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,— Ham. [Aside.| A little more than kin, and less than kind. King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you? Ham. Not so, my lord; I am too much i’ the sun. Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off, And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark. Do not for ever with thy vailed? lids Seek for thy noble father in the dust. Thou know’st ’tis common; all that lives must die, Passing through nature to eternity. Ham. Ay, madam, it is common. Queen. If it be, Why seems it so particular with thee? Ham. Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not “seems.” *Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits of solemn black, Nor windy suspiration of forc’d breath, No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, Nor the dejected haviour® of the visage, Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief, That can denote me truly. These indeed seem, For they are actions that a man might play; But I have that within which passeth show, These but the trappings and the suits of woe. 5 Lowered. © Behavior.

102 SHAKESPEARE King. ’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, To give these mourning duties to your father. But, you must know, your father lost a father; That father lost, lost his; and the survivor bound In filial obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness; ‘tis unmanly grief; It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, An understanding simple and unschool’d; For what we know must be, and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense, Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart? Fie! ’tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd, whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, From the first corse till he that died to-day, “This must be so.” We pray you, throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father; for, let the world take note, You are the most immediate to our throne, And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son, Do I impart towards you. For your intent In going back to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde’ to our desire; And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son. Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet, I prithee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg. Ham. J shall in all my best obey you, madam, King. Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply. Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come; 7 Opposed.

HAMLET 103 This gentle and unforc’d accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof, No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day, But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, And the King’s rouse® the heavens shall bruit® again, Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away. Flourish. Exeunt all but HaMiet, Ham. O, that this too too solid flesh would melt, Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew! Or that the Everlasting had not fix’d His canon ’gainst self-slaughter! O God! God! How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable, Seems to me all the uses of this world! Fie on’t! oh fie, fie! "Tis an unweeded garden, That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely.” That it should come to this! But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two. So excellent a king; that was, to this, Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother That he might not beteem" the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him, As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on; and yet, within a month,— Let me not think on ’t!—Frailty, thy name is woman!— A little month, or e’er those shoes were old With which she followed my poor father’s body, Like Niobe, all tears—why she, even she— O God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,” Would have mourn’d longer—married with mine uncle,. My father’s brother, but no more like my father Than I to Hercules; within a month, Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing’ of her galled eyes, She married.

104 SHAKESPEARE With such dexterity to incestuous sheets! It is not, nor it cannot come to good.— But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue. Enter Horatio, Marcetius, and BERNARDO . Hor. Hail to your lordship! Ham. I am glad to see you well, Horatio!—or I do forget myself. Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever. Ham. Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you. And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus? Mar. My good lord! Ham. 1 am very glad to see you. [To Ber.] Good even, sir— But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg? Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord. Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so, Nor shall you do mine ear that violence, To make it truster of your own report Against yourself. I know you are no truant. But what is your affair in Elsinore? We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart. Hor. My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral. Ham. | pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student. I think it was to see my mother’s wedding. Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon. Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak’d-meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables. Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Ere I had ever seen that day, Horatio! My father!—methinks I see my father. Hor. Oh, where, my lord? Ham. In my mind’s eye, Horatio, Hor.1 saw him once; he was a goodly king. Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again.

HAMLET 105 Hor, My lord, I think I saw him yesternight. Ham. Saw? Who? Hor. My lord, the King your father. Ham. The King my father! Hor. Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear, till I may deliver, Upon the witness of these gentlemen, This marvel to you. Ham. For God’s love, let me hear. Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen, Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch, In the dead waste and middle of the night, Been thus encount’red. A figure like your father, Arm’d at all points exactly, cap-a-pie, Appears before them, and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk’d By their oppress’d and fear-surprised eyes, Within his truncheon’s length; whilst they, distill’d’® Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did, And I with them the third night kept the watch; Where, as they had deliver’d, both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, The apparition comes. I knew your father; These hands are not more like. Ham. But where was this! Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch’d. Ham. Did you not speak to it? Hor. My lord, I did; But answer made it none. Yet once methought It lifted up it’® head and did address Itself to motion, like as it would speak; But even then the morning cock crew loud, And at the sound it shrunk in haste away, And vanish'd from our sight. M4 Wonder. Melted. 18 Its.

106 SHAKESPEARE Ham. *Tis very strange. Hor. As I do live, my honour’d lord, ’tis true, And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it. Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me. Hold you the watch to-night? sae \ We do, my lord. Ham. Arm’d, say you? Mar. Ber. Ham. From top to toe? Mor, \ My lord, from head to foot. \ Arm’d, my lord. Ber, Ham. Then saw you not his face? Hor. O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up. Ham. What, look’d he frowningly? Hor. A countenance more In sorrow than in anger. Ham. . Pale, or red? Hor. Nay, very pale. Ham. And fix’d his eyes upon you? Hor. Most constantly. Ham. I would I had been there. Hor. It would have much amaz’d you. Ham. Very like, very like. Stay’d it long? Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred, Mar. Ber. Hor. Not when I saw ’t. Ham. His beard was grizzly? No? Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life, A sable silver’d. Ham. I will watch to-night; Perchance ’twill walk again. Hor. I warrant you it will. \ Longer, longer.

HAMLET 107 Ham. If it assume my noble father’s person, V'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all, If you have hitherto conceal’d this sight, Let it be tenable” in your silence still; And whatsoever else shall hap to-night, Give it an understanding, but no tongue. I will requite your loves. So, fare ye well. Upon the platform ’twixt eleven and twelve, Pil visit you. All. Our duty to your honour. Ham. Your love, as mine to you; farewell. Exeunt [all but Hamuer]. My father’s spirit in arms! All is not well; I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come! Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s eyes. Exit. Scene III. [4 room in Polonius’s house] Enter Larrtes and OPHELIA Laer. My necessaries are embark’d, farewell; And, sister, as the winds give benefit And convoy is assistant, do not sleep, But let me hear from you. Oph. Do you doubt that? Laer, For Hamlet and the trifling of his favours, Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood, A violet in the youth of primy’ nature, Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting, The [perfume and] suppliance’ of a minute; No more. Oph. No more but so? Laer, Think it no more: For nature crescent does not grow alone 17 Held, In the spring, lusty. 2 What fills in.

108 SHAKESPEARE In thews? and bulk, but, as this temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now, And now no soil nor cautel* doth besmirch The virtue of his will; but you must fear, His greatness weigh’d, his will is not his own; For he himself is subject to his birth. He may not, as unvalued persons do, Carve for himself, for on his choice depends The sanity and health of the whole state; And therefore must his choice be circumscrib’d Unto the voice and yielding’ of that body Whereof he is the head. Then, if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain If with too credent® ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmast’red importunity. Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, And keep you in the rear of your affection, Out of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maid is prodigal enough, If she unmask her beauty to the moon. Virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes. The canker’ galls the infants of the spring Too oft before the buttons® be disclos’d, And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be wary then, best safety lies in fear; Youth to itself rebels, though none else near. OpA. I shall the effect of this good lesson keep, As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother, Do not, as some ungracious pastors do, 3 Muscles. 4 Deceit. Consent. ©Credulous. 7 Canker-worm. 8 Buds.

O, fear me not, Enter Povonius I stay too long: but here my father comes, A double blessing is a double grace; Occasion smiles upon a second leave. Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame! The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, And you are stay’d for. There; my blessing with youl! And these few precepts in thy memory See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportion’d thought his act. Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar. The friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch’d, unfledg’d comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in, Bear ’t that the opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice; Take each man’s censure,”® but reserve thy judgement. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not express’d in fancy; rich, not gaudy; For the apparel oft proclaims the man, And they in France of the best rank and station Are most select and generous in that. Neither a borrower nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.” This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. 9 Advice. Opinion. 1 Thrift. 109

IIo SHAKESPEARE Farewell; my blessing season this in thee! Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord. Pol. The time invites you; go, your servants tend. Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well What I have said to you. Oph. *Tis in my memory lock’d, And you yourself shall keep the key of it. Laer. Farewell. Exit. Pol. What is ’t, Ophelia, he hath said to you? Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet. Pol. Marry, well bethought. *Tis told me, he hath very oft of late Given private time to you, and you yourself Have of your audience been most free and bounteous. If it be so—as so "tis put on me, And that in way of caution—I must tell you, You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behoves my daughter and your honour. What is between you? Give me up the truth. OpA. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders’ Of his affection to me. Pol. Affection! pooh! You speak like a green girl, Unsifted in such perilous circumstance. Do you believe his tenders, as you call them? Oph. 1 do not know, my lord, what I should think. Pol. Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby That you have ta’en his tenders for true pay, Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly, Or—not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, Running it thus—you’ll tender me a fool. Oph. My lord, he hath importun’d me with love In honourable fashion. Pol, Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to. Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven. Pol. Ay, springes’® to catch woodcocks. I do know, 12 Offers. 13 Snares. 2

HAMLET III When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both Even in their promise, as it is a-making, You must not take for fire. From this time, daughter, Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence. Set your entreatments™ at a higher rate Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him, that he is young, And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers, Not of that dye which their investments” show, But mere implorators™ of unholy suits, Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds, The better to beguile. This is for all: I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth, Have you so slander any moment leisure As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet. Look to ’t, I charge you. Come your ways. Oph. I shall obey, my lord. Exeunt. [Scene IV. The platform] Enter HamMuet, Horatio, and MarcE.ius Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold. Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air. Ham. What hour now? Hor. I think it lacks of twelve. Mar. No, it is struck. ; Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. Then it draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk. A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off [within]. What does this mean, my lord? Ham.

What may this mean, That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous, and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? Say, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do? Ghost beckons Hater. Hor. It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone. Mar. Look, with what courteous action It wafts you to a more removed ground. But do not go with it. Hor. No, by no means. Ham. It will not speak; then will I follow it. Hor. Do not, my lord. Ham.

But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison-house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, Thy knotty and combined locks to part And each particular hair to stand on end, Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.’ But this eternal blazon’ must not be To ears of flesh and blood. List, Hamlet, O, list! If thou didst ever thy dear father love— Ham. O God! Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder. Ham. Murder! Ghost. Murder most foul, as in the best it is, But this most foul, strange, and unnatural. Ham. Haste me to know ’t, that I, with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge. Ghost. I find thee apt; And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,’ Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.

116 SHAKESPEARE The serpent that did sting thy father’s life Now wears his crown. Ham. O my prophetic soul! Mine uncle! Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,— O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power So to seduce!—won to his shameful lust The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen, O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there! From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage, and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine! But virtue, as it never will be moved, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, So lust, though to a radiant angel link’d, Will sate itself in a celestial bed And prey on garbage. But, soft! methinks I scent the morning’s air. Brief let me be. Sleeping within mine orchard, My custom always in the afternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, With juice of cursed hebenon’ in a vial, And in the porches of mine ears did pour The leperous distilment; whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilver it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body, And with a sudden vigour it doth posset’ And curd, like eager* droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine, And a most instant tetter® bark’d about, Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust, All my smooth body. 6 An unknown poison. 7Thicken. 8 Sour. 9 Scurf.

O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible! If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not; Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damned incest. But, howsoever thou pursuest this act, Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge, To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once! The glow-worm shows the matin to be near, And ’gins to pale his uneffectual fire. Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me. Exit. Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! .What else? And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, my heart, And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee! Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat In this distracted globe. Remember thee! Yea, from the table of my memory I'll wipe away all trivial fond’* records, All saws" of books, all forms, all pressures past, That youth and observation copied there, And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmix’d with baser matter.

Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo. Rey. I will, my lord. Pol. You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,

HAMLET : I21I Before you visit him, to make inquiry Of his behaviour. Rey. My lord, I did intend it. Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir, Inquire me first what Danskers’ are in Paris, And how, and who, what means, and where they keep, What company, at what expense; and finding By this encompassment and drift’ of question That they do know my son, come you more nearer Than your particular demands will touch it. Take you, as ’twere, some distant knowledge of him, As thus, “I know his father and his friends, And in part him.” Do you mark this, Reynaldo? Rey. Ay, very well, my lord. Pol. “And in part him; but,” you may say, “not well. But, if ’t be he I mean, he’s very wild, Addicted so and so;” and there put on him What forgeries* you please; marry, none so rank As may dishonour him,—take heed of that; But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips As are companions noted and most known To youth and liberty. Rey. As gaming, my lord? Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling, Drabbing; you may go so far. Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him. Pol.

I22 SHAKESPEARE Rey. But, my good lord, — Pol, Wherefore should you do this? Rey. Ay, my lord, I would know that. Pol. Marry, sir, here’s my drift, And, I believe, it is a fetch of warrant:” You laying these slight sullies on my son, As ’twere a thing a little soil’d i’ the working, Mark you, Your party in converse, him you would sound, Having ever seen in the prenominate® crimes The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur’d He closes with you in this consequence;° “Good sir,” or so, or “friend,” or “gentleman,” According to the phrase and the addition” Of man and country. Rey. Very good, my lord. Pol. And then, sir, does he this—he does— What was I about to say? [By the mass,] I was about to say something. Where did I leave? Rey. At “closes in the consequence,” at “friend or so,” and “gentleman.” Pol. At “closes in the consequence,” ay, marry. He closes with you thus: “I know the gentleman. I saw him yesterday, or t’ other day, Or then, or then, with such and such; and, as you say, There was he gaming; there o’ertook in ’s rouse;” There falling out at tennis;” or, perchance, “I saw him enter such a house of sale,” Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.

HAMLET 122 So by my former lecture and advice, Shall you my son. You have me, have you not? Rey. My lord, I have. Pol. God buy you; fare you well. Rey. Good my lord. Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself. Rey. I shall, my lord. Pol. And let him ply his music. Rey. Well, my lord. Pol. Farewell! Exit ReyNa.po. Enter OPHELIA How now, Ophelia! what’s the matter? Oph. Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted! Pol. With what, in the name of God? Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber, Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac’d,” No hat upon his head, his stockings foul’d, Ungart’red, and down-gyved" to his ankle, Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other, And with a look so piteous in purport As if he had been loosed out of hell To speak of horrors,—he comes before me. Pol. Mad for thy love? Oph. My lord, I do not know, But truly, I do fear it. Pol. What said he? Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard; Then goes he to the length of all his arm, And, with his other hand thus o’er his brow, He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it. Long stay’d he so. At last, a little shaking of mine arm, And thrice his head thus waving up and down He rais’d a sigh so piteous and profound That it did seem to shatter all his bulk 3Ungirt. Hanging in rings like fetters.

124 SHAKESPEARE And end his being. That done, he lets me go; And, with his head over his shoulder turn’d, He seem’d to find his way without his eyes, For out o’ doors he went without their help, And, to the last, bended their light on me. Pol. [Come,] go with me, I will go seek the King. This is the very ecstasy of love, Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures. I am sorry,— What, have you given him any hard words of late? Oph. No, my good lord, but, as you did command, I did repel his letters and deni’d His access to me. Pol. That hath made him mad. I am sorry that with better heed and judgement I had not quoted” him. I fear’d he did but trifle And meant to wreck thee; but beshrew my jealousy! By heaven, it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King. This must be known, which, being kept close, might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love. [Come. | Exeunt. Scene II. [4 room in the castle] Flourish.

HAMLET 125 Of Hamlet’s transformation; so I call it, Since not the exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was. What it should be, More than his father’s death, that thus hath put him So much from the understanding of himself, I cannot dream of. I entreat you both, That, being of so young days brought up with him And since so neighbour’d to his youth and humour, That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court Some little time; so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather So much as from occasions you may glean, [ Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,] That, open’d, lies within our remedy. Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk’d of you; And sure I am two men there are not living To whom he more adheres. If it will please you To show us so much gentry’ and good will As to expend your time with us a while For the supply and profit of our hope, Your visitation shall receive such thanks As fits a king’s remembrance.

The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, Are joyfully return’d. King. Thou still hast been the father of good news. Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege, I hold my duty as I hold my soul, Both to my God and to my gracious king. And I do think, or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath us’d to do, that I have found The very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy. King. O, speak of that; that I do long to hear. Pol. Give first admittance to the ambassadors. My news shall be the fruit to that great feast. King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in. [ Exit Potontus.] He tells me, my sweet queen, that he hath found The head and source of all your son’s distemper. Queen.

My liege, and madam, to expostulate What majesty should be, what duty is, Why day is day, night night, and time is time, Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time; Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, I will be brief. Your noble son is mad. Mad call I it; for, to define true madness, What is ’t but to be nothing else but mad? But let that go. Queen. More matter, with less art. Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all. That he is mad, ’tis true; ’tis true ’tis pity, And pity ’tis ’tis true. A foolish figure! 3Deceived. 4 Time for deliberation.

128 SHAKESPEARE But farewell it, for I will use no art. Mad let us grant him then; and now remains That we find out the cause of this effect, Or rather say, the cause of this defect, For this effect defective comes by cause. Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.® I have a daughter—have whilst she is mine— Who, in her duty and obedience, mark, Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise. [Reads] the letter. “To the celestial and my soul’s idol, the most beautified Ophelia,’— That’s an ill phrase, a vile phrase; “beautified” is a vile phrase. But you shall hear. Thus: “In her excellent white bosom, these.” Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her? Pol. Good madam, stay a while. I will be faithful. [Reads.] “Doubt thou the stars are fire, Doubt that the sun doth move, Doubt truth to be a liar, But never doubt I love. “O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers. I have not art to reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu. Thine evermore, most dear lady, Whilst this machine is to him, HaM_er.” This in obedience hath my daughter show’d me, And more above, hath his solicitings, As they fell out by time, by means, and place, All given to mine ear. King. But how hath she Receiv’d his love? Pol. What do you think of me? King. As of a man faithful and honourable. Pol. 1 would fain prove so. But what might you think, 5 Consider.

HAMLET 129 When I had seen this hot love on the wing,— As I perceiv’d it, I must tell you that, Before my daughter told me,—what might you, Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think, If I had play’d the desk or table-book, Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb, Or look’d upon this love with idle sight, What might you think? No, I went round to work, And my young mistress thus I did bespeak: “Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star. This must not be;” and then I precepts gave her, That she should lock herself from his resort, Admit no messengers, receive no tokens. Which done, she took the fruits of my advice; And he, repulsed—a short tale to make— Fell into a sadness, then into a fast, Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness, Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension, Into the madness wherein now he raves, _ And all we wail for. King. Do you think ’tis this? Queen. It may be, very likely. Pol. Hath there been such a time—I’d fain know that— That I have positively said, “Tis so,” When it prov’d otherwise? King. Not that I know. Pol. Take this from this, if this be otherwise. If circumstances lead me, I will find Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed Within the centre. King. How may we try it further? Pol. You know, sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby. Queen. So he has, indeed. Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him. Be you and I behind an arras’ then; ® Range of fortune. 7 Tapestry.

130 SHAKESPEARE Mark the encounter. If he love her not And be not from his reason fallen thereon, Let me be no assistant for a state, But keep a farm and carters. King. We will try it. Enter HaMiet, reading on a book Queen, But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading. Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away. I'll board* him presently. Exeunt Kine, Queen [and Attendants]. O, give me leave, How does my good Lord Hamlet? Ham. Well, God-a-mercy. Pol. Do you know me, my lord? Ham. Excellent well; you are a fishmonger. Pol. Not I, my lord. Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man. Pol. Honest, my lord! Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man pick’d out of ten thousand. Pol. That’s very true, my lord. Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing carrion,—Have you a daughter? Pol. 1 have, my lord. Ham. Let her not walk i’ the sun. Conception is a blessing, but not as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to ’t. Pol. { Aside.] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter. Yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger. He is far gone, far gone. And truly in my youth I suff'red much extremity for love; very near this. I'll speak to him again—What do you read, my lord? Ham. Words, words, words. Pol. What is the matter, my lord? Ham. Between who? ; 8Accost.

HAMLET 131 Pol. I mean, the matter you read, my lord. Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards, that their faces are wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber or plum-tree gum, and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with weak hams; all which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab you could go backward. Pol. | Aside.| Though this be madness, yet there is method in ’t— Will you walk out of the air, my lord? Ham. Into my grave? Pol. Indeed, that is out o’ the air. [ Aside.] How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be deliver’d of. I will leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter—My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you. Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more willingly part withal,—[ Aside] except my life, my life. Pol. Fare you well, my lord. Ham. These tedious old fools! Enter RosENcraANtTz and GUILDENSTERN Pol. You go to seek my Lord Hamlet? There he is. Ros. [To Potontus.] God save you, sir! [Exit Potontus.] Guil. Mine honour’d lord! Ros. My most dear lord! Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Oh, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both? Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth. Guil. Happy, in that we are not over-happy. On Fortune’s cap we are not the very button. Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe? Ros. Neither, my lord. Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favour?

132 SHAKESPEARE Guil. Faith, her privates we. Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? Oh, most true; she is a strumpet. What’s the news? Ros. None, my lord, but that the world’s grown honest. Ham. Then is doomsday near. But your news is not true. Let me question more in particular. What have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of Fortune, that she sends you to prison hither? Guil. Prison, my lord? Ham. Denmark’s a prison. Ros. Then is the world one. Ham. A goodly one, in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o’ the worst. Ros. We think not so, my lord. Ham, Why, then ’tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison. Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. "Tis too narrow for your mind. Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams. Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream. Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow. Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow. Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch’d heroes the beggars’ shadows. Shall we to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason. Ros. Guil. Ham. No such matter. I will not sort you with the rest of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore? Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion. Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks, but I thank you; and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. We'll wait upon you.

HAMLET 133 Were you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come. Nay, speak. Guil. What should we say, my lord? Ham. Why, anything, but to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour. I know the good king and queen have sent for you. Ros. To what end, my lord? Ham, That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent for or no! Ros. [Aside to Gutt.] What say you? Ham. | Aside.| Nay, then, I have an eye of you.—If you love me, hold not off. Guil, My lord, we were sent for. Ham. 1 will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent’ your discovery,"° and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather. I have of late—but wherefore I know not—lost all my mirth, foregone all custom of exercise; and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason! How infinite in faculty! In form and moving how express” and admirable! In action how like an angel! In apprehension how like a god! The beauty of the world! The paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me—no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so. Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts. Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said, “Man delights not me”? ® Anticipate. Revelation. Adorned. 1? Exact.

134 SHAKESPEARE Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted” them on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service. Ham. He that plays.the king shall be welcome; his majesty“ shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight“ shall use his foil and target; the lover” shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man” shall end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o’ the sere’, and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for ’t. What players are they? Ros. Even those you were wont to take delight in, the tragedians of the city. Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways. Ros. I think their inhibition” comes by the means of the late innovation.” Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are they so follow’d? Ros. No, indeed, they are not. Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty? Ros, Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,’* that cry out on the top of question, and are most tyrannically clapp’d for ’t. These are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages””—so they call them— that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills” and dare scarce come thither. Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains ’em? How are they escoted?*” Will they pursue the quality* no longer than they can sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players,—as it is most like, if their means are no better—their writers do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their own succession ?™ Ros.

Do the boys carry it away?” Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.” Ham. It is not strange; for mine uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while my father lived, give twenty, forty, [fifty,] an hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little. [’Sblood,] there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out. Flourish for the Players. Guil. There are the players. Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.

Come, give us a taste of your quality; come, a passionate speech. 1. Play. What speech, my lord? Ham. heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted; or, if it was, not above once. For the play, I remember, pleas’d not the million; ’twas caviare to the general;** but it was—as I receiv’d it, and others, whose judgement in such matters cried in the top of mine*—an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there were no sallets® in the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation; but call’d it an honest method, [as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine.] One speech in it I chiefly lov’d; ‘twas AEneas’ tale to Dido, and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of Priam’s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at this line: let me see, let me see— “The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,” —It is not so. It begins with Pyrrhus:— “The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms, Black as his purpose, did the night resemble When he lay couched in the ominous horse, Hath now this dread and black complexion smear’d With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot Now is he total gules," horribly trick’d® With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, Bak’d and impasted with the parching streets That lend a tyrannous and damned light To their vile murders. Roasted in wrath and fire, And thus o’er-sized with coagulate gore.

His antique sword, Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls, Repugnant to command. Unequal match, Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide. But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium, Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash Takes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear; for, lo! his sword, Which was declining on the milky head Of reverend Priam, seem’d i’ the air to stick. So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood And like a neutral to his will and matter, Did nothing. But, as we often see, against some storm, A silence in the heavens, the rack* stand still, The bold winds speechless and the orb below As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder Doth rend the region;* so, after Pyrrhus’ pause, Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work; And never did the Cyclops’ hammers fall On Mars his armour forg’d for proof eterne With less remorse than Pyrrhus’ bleeding sword Now falls on Priam. Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods, In general synod take away her power! Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel, And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven As low as to the fiends!” Pol. This is too long. Ham. It shall to the barber’s, with your beard.

[Exit First Player.] My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome to Elsinore. Ros. Good my lord! Exeunt [Rosencrantz and GUILDENSTERN. | Ham. Ay, so, God buy ye—Now I am alone. O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I! Is it not monstrous that this player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own conceit That from her working all his visage wann’d, Tears in his eyes, distraction in ’s aspect, A broken voice, and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing! For Hecuba! What’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her? What would he do, Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have? He would drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid speech, Make mad the guilty and appall the free,” Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I, A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of” my cause, And can say nothing; no, not for a king, Upon whose property and most dear life A damn’d defeat’? was made. Am I a coward? Who calls me villain, breaks my pate across, Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face, Tweaks me by the nose, gives me the lie i’ the throat As deep as to the lungs, who does me this? Ha! 5lInnocent. 52 Unquickened by. 5 Destruction.

Bloody, bawdy villain! Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless® villain! O, vengeance! Why, what an ass am I! Sure, this is most brave, That I, the son of a dear father murdered, Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words, And fall a-cursing, like a very drab, A scullion! Fie upon ’t! Foh! About, my brain! I have heard That guilty creatures sitting at a play Have by the very cunning of the scene Been struck so to the soul that presently® They have proclaim’d their malefactions; For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players Play something like the murder of my father Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks; I'll tent®” him to the quick. If he but blench, I know my course. The spirit that I have seen May be the devil; and the devil hath power To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps Out of my weakness and my melancholy, As he is very potent with such spirits, Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds More relative™ than this. The play’s the thing Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the King. Exit. 54Of the air, Unnatural. 56 At once. 57 Probe. 58 Conclusive.

And can you, by no drift of circumstance,’ Get from him why he puts on this confusion, Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy? Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted; But from what cause he will by no means speak. Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded, But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof When we would bring him on to some confession Of his true state. Queen. Did he receive you well? Ros. Most like a gentleman. Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition. Ros. Niggard of question; but, of our demands, Most free in his reply. Queen. Did you assay him To any pastime? Ros. Madam, it so fell out, that certain players We o’er-raught” on the way; of these we told him, And there did seem in him a kind of joy To hear of it. They are about the court, And, as I think, they have already order This night to play before him. Pol. *Tis most true. And he beseech’d me to entreat your Majesties To hear and see the matter. King.

Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them. To die; to sleep; No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to. "Tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish’d. To die; to sleep;— To sleep? Perchance to dream! Ay, there ’s the rub;’ For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, When we have shuffl’d off this mortal coil,® Must give us pause. There’s the respect That makes calamity of so long life. For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely, The pangs of dispriz’d’ love, the law’s delay, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus’® make With a bare bodkin?’ Who would fardels” bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death, The undiscovered country from whose bourn™ No traveller returns, puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all; And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,” And enterprises of great pith and moment With this regard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action—Soft you now!

HAMLET 145 The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins rememb’red. Oph. Good my Lord, How does your honour for this many a day? Ham. 1 humbly thank you, well, well, well. Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours That I have longed long to re-deliver. I pray you, now receive them. Ham. No, no; I never gave you aught. Oph. My honour’d lord, I know right well you did, And, with them, words of so sweet breath compos’d As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost, Take these again; for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind. There, my lord. Ham. Ha ha! are you honest ?™ Oph. My lord! Ham. Are you fair? Oph. What means your lordship? Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty. Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce’ than with honesty? Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once. OpA. Indeed, my lord you made me believe so. Ham. You should not have believ’d me, for virtue cannot so inoculate” our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you not. Oph. I was the more deceived. Ham. Get thee to a nunnery; why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me. I Chaste. 6Intercourse. 17 Graft.

Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in ’s own house. Farewell! Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens! Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go. Farewell! Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, and quickly too. Farewell! Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him! Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God has given you one face and you make yourselves another. You jig, you amble, and you lisp and nick-name God’s creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on ’t; it hath made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that are married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go. Exit. Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o’erthrown! The courtier’s, soldier’s, scholar’s, eye, tongue, sword; The expectancy and rose of the fair state, The glass of fashion and the mould of form, The observ’d of all observers, quite, quite down! And I, of ladies most deject and wretched, That suck’d the honey of his music vows, Now see that noble and most sovereign reason, Like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh; That unmatch’d form and feature of blown”™ youth Blasted with ecstasy."° O, woe is me, To have seen what I have seen, see what I see! 18 Full-blown. 1! Madness.

HAMLET 147 Re-enter Kinc and Potontus King. Love! his affections do not that way tend; Nor what he spake, though it lack’d form a little, Was not like madness. There’s something in his soul O’er which his melancholy sits on brood, And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose” Will be some danger; which for to prevent, I have in quick determination Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England For the demand of our neglected tribute. Haply the seas and countries different With variable objects shall expel This something-settled matter in his heart, Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself. What think you on’t? Pol. It shall do well; but yet do I believe The origin and commencement of this grief Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia! You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said; We heard it all. My lord, do as you please, But, if you hold it fit, after the play Let his queen mother all alone entreat him To show his griefs. Let her be round™ with him, And I'll be plac’d, so please you, in the ear Of all their conference. If she find him not, To England send him, or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think. King. It shall be so. Madness in great ones must not unwatch’d go. Exeunt. [Scene II. A hall in the castle] Enter Hamer and Players Ham.

Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to see a robustious' periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings’ who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise. I could have such a fellow whipp’d for o’erdoing Termagant.’ It out-herods Herod.* Pray you, avoid it. 1. Play. | warrant your honour. Ham. Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o’erstep not the modesty* of nature. For anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as ’twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age® and body of the time his form and pressure.’ Now this overdone, or come tardy off,’ though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure’ of the which one must, in your allowance, o’erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature’s journeymen had made men and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably. 1. Play. 1 hope we have reform’d that indifferently with us, sir. Ham. O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them; for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered.

No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp, And crook the pregnant" hinges of the knee Where thrift” may follow fawning. Dost thou hear? Since my dear soul was mistress of my choice And could of men distinguish, her election Hath seal’d thee for herself; for thou hast been As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing, A man that Fortune’s buffets and rewards Hath ta’en with equal thanks; and blest are those Whose blood and judgement are so well commingled, That they are not a pipe for Fortune’s finger To sound what stop she please.

The dumb-show enters. Enter a King and Queen very lovingly, the Queen embracing him. She kneels and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up and declines his head upon her neck; lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours potson in the King’s ears, and exit. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The poisoner woos the Queen with 15 Furs, or black garments.

For us, and for our tragedy, Here stooping to your clemency, We beg your hearing patiently. [Exit.] Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring? OpA. "Tis brief, my lord. Ham. As woman’s love. Enter [two Players,] a King and his Queen P. King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus’ cart® gone round Neptune’s salt wash and Tellus’ orbed ground, And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen About the world have times twelve thirties been, Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands Unite commutual in most sacred bands. P. Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon Make us again count o’er ere love be done! But, woe is me, you are so sick of late, So far from cheer and from your former state, That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust, Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must; For women’s fear and love holds quantity,” In neither aught, or in extremity.

HAMLET 153 And as my love is siz’d, my fear is so. {Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear; Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.] P. King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too. My operant powers their functions leave to do; And thou shalt live in this fair world behind, Honour’d, belov’d; and haply one as kind. For husband shalt thou— P. Queen. O, confound the rest! Such love must needs be treason in my breast! In second husband let me be accurst! None wed the second but who kill’d the first. Ham. [ Aside.]| Wormwood, wormwood! P. Queen. The instances that second marriage move Are base respects of thrift, but none of love. A second time I kill my husband dead, When second husband kisses me in bed. P. King. I do believe you think what now you speak, But what we do determine oft we break. Purpose is but the slave to memory, Of violent birth, but poor validity; Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree, But fall unshaken when they mellow be. Most necessary ’tis that we forget To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt. What to ourselves in passion we propose, The passion ending, doth the purpose lose. The violence of either grief or joy Their own enactures” with themselves destroy. Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament; Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident. This world is not for aye, nor ’tis not strange That even our loves should with our fortunes change, For ’tis a question left us yet to prove, Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love. The great man down, you mark his favourite flies; 20 Acts,

And hitherto doth love on fortune tend, For who not needs shall never lack a friend; And who in want a hollow friend doth try, Directly seasons him his enemy. But, orderly to end where I begun, Our wills and fates do so contrary run That our devices still are overthrown; Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own. So think thou wilt no second husband wed; But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead. P. Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light! Sport and repose lock from me day and night! [To desperation turn my trust and hope! An anchor’s cheer” in prison be my scope! | Each opposite” that blanks” the face of joy Meet what I would have well and it destroy! Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife, If, once a widow, ever I be wife! Ham. If she should break it now! P. King. "Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here a while. My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile The tedious day with sleep. Sleeps. P. Queen. Sleep rock thy brain, And never come mischance between us twain! Exit. Ham. Madam, how like you this play? Queen. The lady protests too much, methinks. Ham. O, but she'll keep her word. King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in ’t? Ham. No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest. No offence i’ the world. King. What do you call the play? Ham. The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically.* This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke’s name; his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. ’Tis a knavish piece of work, but what o’ that? Your Majesty and we that have free souls, it 21 Hermit’s fare. 2?

Do you see that cloud that’s almost in shape like a camel? Pol. By the mass, and it’s like a camel, indeed. Ham, Methinks it is like a weasel. Pol. It is back’d like a weasel. Ham. Or like a whale? Pol. Very like a whale. Ham. Then will I come to my mother by and by. [ Aside.] They fool me to the top of my bent.—I will come by and by. Pol. 1 will say so. Exit. 38 Wind-holes. 39 A pun on fret, to irritate and fret, a bar on a stringed instrument to guide the fingers.

HAMLET 159 Ham. “By and by” is easily said. Leave me, friends. [Exeunt all but Hamuet.] *Tis now the very witching time of night When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood, And do such bitter business as the day Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother, O heart, lose not thy nature! Let not ever The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom; Let me be cruel, not unnatural. I will speak daggers to her, but use none. My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites; How in my words soever she be shent® To give them seals never, my soul, consent! Exit. [Scene III. 4 room in the castle] Enter Kine, Rosencrantz, and GUILDENSTERN King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you. I your commission will forthwith dispatch, And he to England shall along with you. The terms of our estate may not endure Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow Out of his lunacies. Guil. We will ourselves provide. Most holy and religious fear it is To keep those many many bodies safe That live and feed upon your Majesty. Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound With all the strength and armour of the mind To keep itself from noyance,' but much more That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests The lives of many.

160 SHAKESPEARE Fixed on the summit of the highest mount, To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortis’d and adjoin’d; which, when it falls Each small annexment, petty consequence, Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone Did the King sigh, but with a general groan. King. Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage, For we will fetters put upon this fear, Which now goes too free-footed. ee \ We will haste us. Exeunt RosENcRANTz and GUILDENSTERN. Enter Potontus Pol. My lord, he’s going to his mother’s closet. Behind the arras I'll convey myself, To hear the process. I’ll warrant she'll tax him home; And, as you said, and wisely was it said, Tis meet that some more audience than a mother, Since nature makes them partial, should o’erhear The speech, of vantage.’ Fare you well, my liege. I'll call upon you ere you go to bed, And tell you what I know. King. Thanks, dear my lord. [Exit Potontus.] O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven; It hath the primal eldest curse upon ’t, A brother’s murder. Pray can I not, Though inclination be as sharp as will. My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent, And, like a man to double business bound, I stand in pause where I shall first begin, And both neglect. What if this cursed hand Were thicker than itself with brother’s blood, Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy 3 From an advantageous position.

HAMLET 161 But to confront the visage of offence? And what’s in prayer but this twofold force, To be forestalled ere we come to fall, Or pardon’d being down? Then I'll look up; My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer Can serve my turn? “Forgive me my foul murder”? That cannot be; since I am still possess’d Of those effects for which I did the murder, My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen. May one be pardon’d and retain the offence ?* In the corrupted currents of this world Offence’s gilded hand may shove by justice, And oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law. But ’tis not so above. There is no shuffling, there the action lies In his true nature; and we ourselves compell’d, Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults, To give in evidence. What then? What rests? Try what repentance can. What can it not? Yet what can it when one cannot repent? O wretched state! O bosom black as death! O limed soul, that, struggling to be free, Art more engag’d! Help, angels! Make assay! Bow, stubborn knees, and, heart with strings of steel, Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe! All may be well. [Retires and] kneels. Enter HaMietr Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying. And now I'll do ’t.—And so he goes to heaven; And so am I reveng’d. That would be scann’d. A villain kills my father, and for that, I, his sole son, do this same villain send To heaven. Oh, this is hire and salary, not revenge. He took my father grossly, full of bread, 4 The profit of the crime.

162 SHAKESPEARE With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May; And how his audit stands who knows save Heaven? But in our circumstance and course of thought *Tis heavy with him. And am I then reveng’d, To take him in the purging of his soul, When he is fit and season’d for his passage? No! Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent. When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage, Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed, At gaming, swearing, or about some act That has no relish of salvation in ’t,— Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven, And that his soul may be as damn’d and black As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays. This physic but prolongs thy sickly days. Exit. King. [Rising.| My words fly up, my thoughts remain below. Words without thoughts never to heaven go. Exit. [Scenz IV. The Oueen’s closet] Enter Queen and Potontus Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him. Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with, And that your Grace hath screen’d and stood between Much heat and him. I'll silence me e’en here. Pray you, be round with him. Ham. (Within.) Mother, mother, mother! Queen. Yll warrant you, fear me not. Withdraw, I hear him coming. [Potontus hides behind the arras.| Enter HaMuer Ham. Now, mother, what’s the matter? Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended. Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended. Queen, Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue. 5 Grip.

HAMLET 163 Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue. Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet! Ham. What’s the matter now? Queen. Have you forgot me? Ham. No, by the rood, not so. You are the Queen, your husband’s brother’s wife; But would you were not so! You are my mother. Queen. Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak. Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge. You go not till I set you up a glass Where you may see the inmost part of you. Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me? Help, help, ho! Pol. [Behind.] What, ho! help, help, help! Ham. [Drawing.| How now! A rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead! Kills Potontus [through the arras]. Pol. [Behind.| O,1am slain! Queen. O me, what hast thou done? Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King? Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this! Ham. A bloody deed! Almost as bad, good mother, As kill a king, and marry with his brother. Queen. As kill a king! Ham. Ay, lady, twas my word. [Lifts up the arras and discovers Potonws. | Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell! I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune. Thou find’st to be too busy is some danger. —Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! Sit you down, And let me wring your heart; for so I shall, If it be made of penetrable stuff, If damned custom have not braz’d it so That it is proof and bulwark against sense. Queen. What have I done, that thou dar’st wag thy tongue In noise so rude against me? 1 Feeling.

164 SHAKESPEARE Ham. Such an act That blurs the grace and blush of modesty, Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose From the fair forehead of an innocent love And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows As false as dicers’ oaths; O, such a deed As from the body of contraction’ plucks The very soul, and sweet religion makes A rhapsody of words. Heaven’s face doth glow, Yea, this solidity and compound mass, With tristful® visage, as against the doom,* Is thought-sick at the act. Queen. Ay me, what act, That roars so loud and thunders in the index?® Ham. Look here, upon this picture, and on this, The counterfeit presentment® of two brothers. See, what a grace was seated on this brow: Hyperion’s curls, the front of Jove himself, An eye like Mars, to threaten or command, A station like the herald Mercury New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill, A combination and a form indeed, Where every god did seem to set his seal, To give the world assurance of a man. This was your husband. Look you now what follows: Here is your husband, like a mildew’d ear, Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes? Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed, And batten’ on this moor? Ha! have you eyes? You cannot call it love, for at your age The hey-day in the blood is tame, it’s humble, And waits upon the judgement; and what judgement Would step from this to this? [Sense sure you have, Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense . 2The marriage contract. Sorrowful. Judgment day. 5Prelude. Portrait. 7 Feed.

HAMLET 165 Is apoplex’d; for madness would not err, Nor sense to ecstasy was ne’er so thrall’d But it reserv’d some quantity’ of choice, To serve in such a difference.] What devil was ’t That thus hath cozen’d you at hoodman-blind?® {Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all, Or but a sickly part of one true sense Could not so mope.’’] O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell, If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones, To flaming youth let virtue be as wax, And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame When the compulsive ardour gives the charge, Since frost itself as actively doth burn And reason panders will. Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more! Thou turn’st mine eyes into my very soul, And there I see such black and grained” spats As will not leave their tinct.” Ham. Nay, but to live In the rank sweat of an enseamed” bed, Stew’d in corruption, honeying and making love Over the nasty sty,— Queen. O, speak to me no more! These words like daggers enter in mine ears. No more, sweet Hamlet! Ham. A murderer and a villain! A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe Of your precedent lord! A vice" of kings! A cutpurse of the empire and the rule, That from a shelf the precious diadem stole, And put it in his pocket! Queen. No more! 8 Portion. 9 Blind-man’s buff. 1°Be stupid. 1!

166 SHAKESPEARE Enter Ghost Ham. A king of shreds and patches,— Save me, and hover o’er me with your wings, You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure? Queen. Alas, he’s mad! Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide, That, laps’d in time and passion,” lets go by The important acting of your dread command? O, say! Ghost. Do not forget! This visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose. But, look, amazement on thy mother sits. O, step between her and her fighting soul. Conceit” in weakest bodies strongest works. Speak to her, Hamlet. Ham. How is it with you, lady? Queen. Alas, how is ’t with you, That you do bend your eye on vacancy And with the incorporal air do hold discourse? Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep, And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm, Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,”” Start up and stand on end. O gentle son, Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look? Ham. On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares! His form and cause conjoin’d, preaching to stones, Would make them capable.“ Do not look upon me, Lest with this piteous action you convert My stern effects; then what I have to do Will want true colour, tears perchance for blood. Queen. To whom do you speak this? Ham. Do you see nothing there? Queen. Nothing at all, yet all that is I see. 1 arama allowed time and passion to go past. SImagination. 1!7 Any outgrowth; here, hair. 48 Susceptible. 1 Actions.

HAMLET 167 Ham. Nor did you nothing hear? Queen. No, nothing but ourselves. Ham. Why, look you there! Look, how it steals away! My father, in his habit as he lived! : Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal! Exit Ghost. Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain. This bodiless creation ecstasy” Is very cunning in. Ham. Ecstasy! My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time, And makes as healthful music. It is not madness That I have uttered. Bring me to the test, And I the matter will re-word, which madness Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace, Lay not that flattering unction to your soul, That not your trespass, but my madness speaks. It will but skin and film the ulcerous place, Whilst rank corruption, mining all within, Infects unseen. Confess yourself to Heavens. Repent what’s past, avoid what is to come, And do not spread the compost on the weeds, To make them rank. Forgive me this my virtue, For in the fatness of these pursy” times Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg, Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good. Queen, O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain. Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it, And live the purer with the other half. Good-night; but go not to mine uncle’s bed. Assume a virtue, if you have it not. {That monster, custom, who all sense” doth eat, Of habits devil, is angel yet in this, That to the use of actions fair and good He likewise gives a frock or livery, That aptly is put on.] Refrain to-night, 20Madness. 2! Overfed. 22 Sensibility.

168 SHAKESPEARE And that shall lend a kind of easiness To the next abstinence; [the next more easy; For use almost can change the stamp of nature, And either master the devil or throw him out, With wondrous potency.] Once more, good-night; And when you are desirous to be blest, T'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord, [Pointing to Potontus.] I do repent; but Heaven hath pleas’d it so, To punish me with this and this with me, That I must be their scourge and minister. I will bestow him, and will answer well The death I gave him. So, again, good-night. I must be cruel, only to be kind. Thus bad begins and worse remains behind. [One word more, good lady.] Queen. What shall I do? Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do: Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed, Pinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse, And let him, for a pair of reechy” kisses, Or paddling in your neck with his damn’d fingers, Make you to ravel all this matter out, That I essentially am not in madness, But mad in craft. "T'were good you let him know; For who, that’s but a queen, fair, sober, wise, Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,” Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so? No, in despite of sense and secrecy, Unpeg the basket on the house’s top, Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape, To try conclusions” in the basket creep, And break your own neck down. Queen, Be thou assur’d, if words be made of breath, And breath of life, I have no life to breathe What thou hast said to me. Ham. I must to England; you know that? 23 Smoky, stinking. 24Tom-cat. 75 Experiments.

HAMLET 169 Queen. Alack, I had forgot. *Tis so concluded on. Ham. [There’s letters sealed, and my two school-fellows, Whom I will trust as I will adders fang’d, They bear the mandate. They must sweep my way, And marshal me to knavery. Let it work; For ’tis the sport to have the enginer Hoist with his own petar;” and ’t shall go hard But I will delve one yard below their mines, And blow them at the moon. O, ’tis most sweet, When in one line two crafts directly meet.] This man shall set me packing. I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room. Mother, good-night. Indeed this counsellor Is now most still, most secret, and most grave, Who was in life a foolish prating knave. Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you. Good-night, mother. Exeunt [severally,] Hamuer tugging in Potontus. [ACT IV] [Scene I. A room in the castle] Enter Kinc [Queen, Rosencrantz, and GuILDENSTERN] King. There’s matter in these sighs; these profound heaves You must translate; ’tis fit we understand them. Where is your son? Queen. {Bestow this place on us a little while.] [Exeunt Rosencrantz and GUILDENSTERN. | Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night! King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet? Queen, Mad as the seas and wind, when both contend Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit, Behind the arras hearing something stir, He whips his rapier out, and cries, “A rat, a rat!” 26 Bomb.

170 SHAKESPEARE And, in his brainish' apprehension, kills The unseen good old man. King. O heavy deed! It had been so with us, had we been there. His liberty is full of threats to all, To you yourself, to us, to every one. Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answered ? It will be laid to us, whose providence Should have kept short, restrain’d, and out of haunt? This mad young man. But so much was our love, We would not understand what was most fit, But, like the owner of a foul disease, To keep it from divulging, let it feed Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone? Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill’d, O’er whom his very madness, like some ore Among the mineral of metals base, Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done. King. O Gertrude, come away! The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch, But we will ship him hence, and this vile deed We must, with all our majesty and skill, Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern! [Re-Jenter Rosencrantz and GUILDENSTERN Friends both, go join you with some further aid. Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain, And from his mother’s closet hath he dragg’d him. Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this. Exeunt Rosencrantz and GUILDENSTERN. Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends To let them know both what we mean to do And what’s untimely done; [so, haply, slander] [Whose whisper o’er the world’s diameter, As level as the cannon to his blank,’ 'Mad, headstrong.

What have you done, my lord, with the dead body? Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto ’tis kin. Ros. Tell us where ’tis, that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel. Ham. Do not believe it. Ros. Believe what? Ham, That I can keep your counsel and not mine own. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! What replication’ should be made by the son of a king? Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord? Ham. Ay, sir, that soaks up the King’s countenance, his rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the King best service in the end. He keeps them, as an ape doth nuts, in the corner of his jaw; first mouth’d, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you have glean’d, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again. Ros. I understand you not, my lord. Ham. 1am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear. Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go with us to the King. Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body. The King is a thing— 1 Reply.

172 SHAKESPEARE Guil. A thing, my lord! Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after? Exeunt. [Scenz III. Another room in the castle} Enter Kine [and two or three] King. I have sent to seek him, and to find the body. How dangerous is it that this man goes loose! Yet must not we put the strong law on him. He’s lov’d of the distracted multitude, Who like not in their judgement, but their eyes, And where ’tis so, the offender’s scourge is weigh’d, But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even, This sudden sending him away must seem Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown By desperate appliance are relieved, Or not at all. Enter RosENCRANTZ How now! What hath befallen? Ros. Where the dead body is bestow’d,’ my lord, We cannot get from him. King. But where is he? Ros. Without, my lord, guarded, to know your pleasure. King. Bring him before us. Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord. Enter HaMuet and GuILDENSTERN King. Now, Hamlet, where’s Polonius? Ham. At supper. King. At supper! Where? Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain convocation of [politic] worms’ are e’en at him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat 2A reference to a game. 1 Hidden. 2? Worms that eat the bodies of politicians.

Ham, A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.] King. What dost thou mean by this? Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar. King. Where is Polonius? Ham. In heaven; send thither to see. If your messenger find him not there, seek him i’ the other place yourself. But indeed, if you find him not [within] this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby. King. Go seek him there. [To some Attendants.] Ham. He will stay till ye come. [Exeunt Attendants. ] King. Hamlet, this deed of thine, for thine especial safety,— Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve For that which thou hast done,—must send thee hence With fiery quickness; therefore prepare thyself. The bark is ready, and the wind at help, The associates tend, and everything is bent For England. Ham. For England? King. Ay, Hamlet. Ham. Good. King. So is it, if thou knew’st our purposes. Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England! Farewell, dear mother. King. Thy loving father, Hamlet. Ham. My mother. Father and mother is man and wife, man and wife is one flesh, and so, my mother. Come, for England! [Exit King. Follow him at foot, tempt him with speed aboard. Delay it not; I’ll have him hence to-night. Away! for everything is seal’d and done That else leans on the affair. Pray you, make haste.

My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach! Good-night, ladies; good-night, sweet ladies; good-night, good-night. King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you. [Exeunt some.] O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs All from her father’s death.

O my dear Gertrude, this, Like to a murdering-piece,"* in many places Gives me superfluous death. A notse within. Enter a Messenger Queen. Alack, what noise is this? King. Where are my Switzers?’?

The ocean, overpeering of his list,’ Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,"’ O’erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord; And, as the world were now but to begin, Antiquity forgot, custom not known, (The ratifiers and props of every word,) They cry, “Choose we! Laertes shall be king!” Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds, “Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!” Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!

I pray you, give me leave. Danes. We will, we will. [They retire without the door.| Laer. I thank you; keep the door. O thou vile king, Give me my father! Queen. Calmly, good Laertes. Laer. That drop of blood that’s calm proclaims me bastard, Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brows Of my true mother. King. What is the cause, Laertes, That thy rebellion looks so giant-like? Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person. There’s such divinity doth hedge a king, That treason can but peep to what it would, Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes, Why thou art thus incens’d. Let him go, Gertrude. Speak, man. Laer. Where’s my father? King. Dead. Queen. But not by him. King. Let him demand his fill. Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggl’d with. To hell, allegiance! Vows, to the blackest devil! Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit! I dare damnation. To this point I stand, That both the worlds I give to negligence, Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng’d Most throughly for my father. King. Who shall stay you? Laer. My will, not all the world. And for my means, I'll husband them so well, They shall go far with little.

HAMLET 181 King. Good Laertes, If you desire to know the certainty Of your dear father’s death, is ’t writ in your revenge That, swoopstake,” you will draw both friend and foe, Winner and loser? Laer. None but his enemies. King. Will you know them then? Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms, And like the kind life-rend’ring pelican, Repast them with my blood. King. Why, now you speak Like a good child and a true gentleman. That I am guiltless of your father’s death, And am most sensibly in grief for it, It shall as level to your judgement pierce As day does to your eye.

[Scrnz VII. Another room in the castle] Enter Kinc and Larrtes King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal; And you must put me in your heart for friend, Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear, That he which hath your noble father slain Pursued my life. Laer. It well appears. But tell me Why you proceeded not against these feats, So crimeful and so capital in nature, As by your safety, wisdom, all things else, You mainly were stirr’d up. King. O, for two special reasons, Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew’d, And yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother Lives almost by his looks; and for myselfi— 1 Merciful thieves. 2 Calibre, greatness.

HAMLET 185 My virtue or my plague, be it either which— She’s so conjunctive’ to my life and soul, That, as the star moves not but in his sphere, I could not but by her. The other motive Why to a public count I might not go, Is the great love the general gender” bear him; Who, dipping all his faults in their affection, Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone, Convert his gyves® to graces; so that my arrows, Too slightly timb’red for so loud a wind, Would have reverted to my bow again, And not where I had aim’d them. Laer. And so have I a noble father lost, A sister driven into desperate terms, Whose worth, if praises may go back again, Stood challenger on mount of all the age For her perfections. But my revenge will come. King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think That we are made of stuff so flat and dull That we can let our beard be shook with danger And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more. I lov’d your father, and we love ourself, And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine— Enter a Messenger with letters How now! What news? Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet. This to your Majesty; this to the Queen. King. From Hamlet! Who brought them? Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not. They were given me by Claudio. He receiv’d them [Of him that brought them]. King. Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us. Exit Messenger. [Reads.] “High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on your kingdom.

Or is it some abuse, or no such thing? Laer. Know you the hand? King. "Tis Hamlet’s character. “Naked!” And in a postscript here, he says, “alone.” Can you advise me? Laer. I’m lost in it, my lord. But let him come. It warms the very sickness in my heart That I shall live and tell him to his teeth, “Thus didest thou.” King. If it be so, Laertes,— As how should it be so? How otherwise ?— Will you be rul’d by me? Laer. [Ay, my lord,] If so you'll not o’errule me to a peace. King. To thine own peace. If he be now return’d, As checking* at his voyage, and that he means No more to undertake it, I will work him To an exploit, now ripe in my device, Under the which he shall not choose but fall; And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe, But even his mother shall uncharge the practice’ And call it accident. [ Laer. My lord, I will be rul’d; The rather, if you could devise it so That I might be the organ. King. It falls right. You have been talk’d of since your travel much, And that in Hamlet’s hearing, for a quality Wherein, they say, you shine. Your sum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him As did that one, and that, in my regard, Of the unworthiest siege.’ 4 Refusing to proceed. Free the plot from blame. ® Instrument, means. 7 Rank.

HAMLET Laer. What part is that, my lord? King. A very riband in the cap of youth, Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes The light and careless livery that it wears Than settled age his sables and his weeds, Importing health and graveness.| Two months since, Here was a gentleman of Normandy;— I’ve seen myself, and serv’d against, the French, And they can well on horseback; but this gallant Had witchcraft in ’t. He grew unto his seat, And to such wondrous doing brought his horse, As had he been incorps’d*® and demi-natur’d With the brave beast. So far he pass’d my thought, That I, in forgery’ of shapes and tricks, Come short of what he did. Laer. A Norman, was ’t? King. A Norman. Laer. Upon my life, Lamound. King. The very same. Laer. 1 know him well. He is the brooch” indeed And gem of all the nation. King. He made confession of you, And gave you such a masterly report For art and exercise in your defence, And for your rapier most especially, That he cried out, ’twould be a sight indeed If one could match you. [The scrimers” of their nation, He swore, had neither motion, guard, nor eye, If you oppos’d them.] Sir, this report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy That he could nothing do but wish and beg Your sudden coming o’er to play with him. Now, out of this— Laer. What out of this, my lord? King. Laertes, was your father dear to you? Or are you like the painting of a sorrow, 8Incorporated. Imagination. 'Ornament. 4! Fencers. 187

188 SHAKESPEARE A face without a heart? Laer. Why ask you this? King. Not that I think you did not love your father, But that I know love is begun by time, And that I see, in passages of proof,” Time qualifies the spark and fire of it. [There lives within the very flame of love A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it, And nothing is at a like goodness still; For goodness, growing to a plurisy,* Dies in his own too much. That we would do, We should do when we would; for this “would” changes, And hath abatements and delays as many As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents; And then this “should” is like a spendthrift sigh,“ That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o’ the ulcer:—] Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake, To show yourself your father’s son in deed More than in words? Laer. To cut his throat i’ the church. King. No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;" Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes, Will you do this, keep close within your chamber? Hamlet return’d shall know you are come home. We'll put on those shall praise your excellence And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gave you, bring you, in fine, together And wager on your heads. He, being remiss, Most generous and free from all contriving, Will not peruse the foils, so that, with ease, Or with a little shuffling, you may choose A sword unbated,"* and in a pass of practice” Requite him for your father. Laer. I will do ’t; And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword. 12 Proved instances. !§Excess. 14 Sighing was supposed to draw blood from the heart, and so shorten life. 15 Protect, as in a sanctuary. 16 Unblunted. 7 Treacherous thrust.

HAMLET I bought an unction of a mountebank,” So mortal that, but dip a knife in it, Where it draws blood no cataplasm” so rare, Collected from all simples” that have virtue Under the moon, can save the thing from death That is but scratch’d withal. P’ll touch my point With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly, It may be death. King. Let’s further think of this, Weigh what convenience both of time and means May fit us to our shape. If this should fail, And that our drift look through our bad performance, *T were better not assay’d; therefore this project Should have a back or second, that might hold If this should blast in proof.” Soft! let me see. We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings,— Tha ’t! When in your motion you are hot and dry— As make your bouts more violent to that end— And that he calls for drink, P’'ll have prepar’d him A chalice for the nonce,” whereon but sipping, If he by chance escape your venom’d stuck,” Our purpose may hold there. But stay, what noise? Enter QuEEN How, sweet queen! Queen. One woe doth tread upon another’s heel, So fast they follow. Your sister’s drown’d, Laertes. Laer. Drown’d! O, where? Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook, That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream. There with fantastic garlands did she come Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples” That liberal* shepherds give a grosser name, But our cold maids do dead men’s fingers call them; 18 Quack doctor. 9 Poultice. 20Herbs. 2! Be blighted in trial. 23 Thrust. 24Qrchis. 25 Free-spoken. 22 Occasion.

Igo SHAKESPEARE There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds Clamb’ring to hang, an envious silver broke, When down her weedy trophies and herself Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide, And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up; Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes, As one incapable of her own distress, Or like a creature native and indued” Unto that element. But long it could not be Till that her garments, heavy with their drink, Pull’d the poor wretch from her melodious lay To muddy death. Laer. Alas, then, is she drown’d? Queen. Drown’d, drown’d. Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia, And therefore I forbid my tears. But yet It is our trick. Nature her custom holds, Let shame say what it will; when these are gone, The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord; I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze, But that this folly douts” it. King. Let’s follow, Gertrude. How much I had to do to calm his rage! Now fear I this will give it start again, Therefore let’s follow. [ACT V] [Scene I. A churchyard] Enter two Clowns [with spades and pickaxes] Exit. Exeunt. 1. Clo. Is she to be buried in Christian burial that wilfully seeks her own salvation? 2. Clo. I tell thee she is, and therefore make her grave straight. The crowner’ hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial. 1. Clo. How can that be, unless she drown’d herself in her own defence? 26Insensible of. 27 Fitted to. 28 Extinguishes. |! Coroner.

HAMLET 19I 2. Clo. Why, ’tis found so. 1. Clo. It must be “se offendendo,’® it cannot be else. For here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act, and an act hath three branches; it is, to act, to do, and to perform; argal,’ she drown’d herself wittingly. 2. Clo. Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,— 1. Clo. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he goes,—mark you that? But if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself; argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life. 2. Clo, But is this law? 1. Clo. Ay, marry, is ’t; crowner’s quest law. 2. Clo, Will you ha’ the truth on ’t? If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o’ Christian burial. 1. Clo. Why, there thou say’st; and the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves, more than their even Christian.* Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers; they hold up Adam’s profession. 2. Clo. Was he a gentleman? 1. Clo. He was the first that ever bore arms. 2. Clo. Why, he had none. 1. Clo. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? The Scripture says Adam digg’d; could he dig without arms? I'll put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself— 2. Clo. Go to. 1. Clo. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter? 2. Clo. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants. 1. Clo. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does well; but how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now, thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church, argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To ’t again, come. 2 The clown’s mistake for “se defendendo.” 3Ergo, therefore. 4 Fellow-Christian. 2

192 SHAKESPEARE 2. Clo. “Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?” 1. Clo. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke. 2. Clo. Marry, now I can tell. 1. Clo. To’t. 2. Clo. Mass, I cannot tell. Enter Hamuet and Horatio, afar off 1. Clo. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when you are ask’d this question next, say “a grave-maker”; the houses that he makes lasts till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of liquor. [Exit Second Clown.] (He digs, and] sings. “In youth, when I did love, did love, Methought it was very sweet, To contract, O, the time for-a my behove, O, methought, there-a was nothing-a meet.” Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at grave-making? Hor. Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.’ Ham. "Tis e’en so. The hand of little employment hath the daintier sense. 1. Clo. (Sings.) “But age, with his stealing steps, Hath claw’d me in his clutch, And hath shipped me intil the land, As if I had never been such.” [Throws up a skull.] Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the knave jowls® it to the ground, as if it were Cain’s jaw-bone,’ that did the first murder! It might be the pate of a politician, which this ass now o’erreaches; one that would circumvent God, might it not? Hor. It might, my lord. 5 A function he performs easily. © Knocks. 7 The ass’s jawbone with which, according to legend, Cain slew Abel.

HAMLET 193 Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say, “Good morrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?” This might be my lord such-aone, that prais’d my lord such-a-one’s horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not? Hor. Ay, my lord. Ham. Why, e’en so; and now my Lady Worm’s; chapless, and knock’d about the mazzard* with a sexton’s spade. Here’s fine revolution, if we had the trick to see ’t. Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but to play at loggats’ with em? Mine ache to think on ’t. 1. Clo. (Sings.) “A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade, For and a shrouding sheet; O, a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet.” [Throws up another skull.} Ham. There’s another. Why might not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddits” now, his quillets,” his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce” with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in ’s time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries.” Is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in this box, and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha? Hor. Not a jot more, my lord. Ham. Is not parchment made of sheep-skins? Hor. Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too. Ham. They are sheep and calves that seek out assurance in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose grave ’s this, sir? 1. Clo. Mine, sir.

194 SHAKESPEARE Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in ’t. 1. Clo. You lie out on ’t, sir, and therefore it is not yours. For my part, I do not lie in ’t, and yet it is mine. Ham. Thou dost lie in ’t, to be in ’t and say ’tis thine. "Tis for the dead, not for the quick, therefore thou liest. 1. Clo. "Tis a quick® lie, sir; twill away again, from me to you. Ham. What man dost thou dig it for? 1. Clo. For no man, sir. Ham. What woman, then? 1. Clo. For none, neither. Ham. Who is to be buried in ’t? 1. Clo. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she’s dead. Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken note of it; the age is grown so picked" that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heels of our courtier, he galls his kibe.* How long hast thou been a grave-maker ? 1. Clo. Of all the days i’ the year, 1 came to ’t that day that our last king Hamlet o’ercame Fortinbras. Ham. How long is that since? 1. Clo. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that was mad, and sent into England. Ham. Ay, marry, why was he sent into England? 1. Clo. Why, because ’a was mad. He shall recover his wits there; or, if he do not, it’s no great matter there. Ham. Why? 1. Clo. ’Twill not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he. Ham. How came he mad? 1. Clo. Very strangely, they say. Ham. How “strangely”? 1. Clo. Faith, e’en with losing his wits. ..Ham. Upon what ground? 1. Clo. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years. Ham. How long will a man lie i’ the earth ere he rot? 13 Living. 14Smart. 1 Chilblain.

HAMLET 195 1. Clo. Y faith, if he be not rotten before he die—as we have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce hold the laying in—he will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last you nine year. Ham. Why he more than another? 1. Clo. Why, sir, his hide is so tann’d with his trade that he will keep out water a great while, and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body. Here’s a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth three and twenty years. Ham. Whose was it? 1. Clo, A whoreson mad fellow’s it was. Whose do you think it was? Ham. Nay, I know not. 1. Clo. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! ’A pour’d a flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick’s skull, the King’s jester. Ham. This? 1. Clo. E’en that. Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath borne me on his back a thousand times. And now how abhorred in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I have kiss’d I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now, your gambols, your songs, your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? Quite chopfallen? Now get you to my lady’s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing. Hor. What ’s that, my lord? Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look’d o’ this fashion i’ the earth? Hor. E’en so. Ham. And smelt so? Pah! [Puts down the skull.] Hor. Een so, my lord. Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till he find it stopping a bung-hole? Hor. ’Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.

196 . SHAKESPEARE Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty® enough and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust, the dust is earth, of earth we make loam, and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer-barrel ? Imperial Czsar, dead and turn’d to clay, Might stop a hole to keep the wind away. O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe, Should patch a wall to expel the winter’s flaw!” But soft! but soft!

O, treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Depriv’d thee of! Hold off the earth a while, Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.

HAMLET [Scene II. A hall in the castle] Enter Hamurr and Horatio Ham. So much for this, sir; now let me see the other, You do remember all the circumstance? Hor, Remember it, my lord! Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting, — That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes.’ Rashly,— And prais’d be rashness for it; let us know Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well When our deep plots do pall; and that should teach us There ’s a divinity that shapes our ends, Rough-hew them how we will,— Hor. That is most certain. Ham. Up from my cabin, My sea-gown scarf’d about me, in the dark Grop’d I to find out them; had my desire; Finger’d their packet; and, in fine, withdrew To mine own room again, making so bold, My fears forgetting manners, to unseal Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,— O royal knavery!—an exact command, Larded’ with many several sorts of reason Importing Denmark’s health and England’s too, With, ho! such bugs’ and goblins in my life, That, on the supervise,’ no leisure bated, No, not to stay the grinding of the axe, My head should be struck off. Hor, Is ’t possible? Ham. Here’s the commission; read it at more leisure. But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed? Hor. 1 beseech you. Ham.

200 SHAKESPEARE They had begun the play,—I sat me down, Devis’d a new commission, wrote it fair. I once did hold it, as our statists® do, A baseness to write fair, and labour’d much How to forget that learning; but, sir, now It did me yeoman’s service. Wilt thou know The effect’ of what I wrote? Hor. Ay, good my lord. Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King, As England was his faithful tributary, As love between them as the palm should flourish, As Peace should still her wheaten garland wear And stand a comma’® ’tween their amities, And many such-like as-es of great charge, That, on the view and knowing of these contents, Without debatement further, more or less, He should the bearers put to sudden death, Not shriving time allow’d. Hor. How was this seal’d? Ham. Why, even in that was Heaven ordinant.’ I had my father’s signet in my purse, Which was the model of that Danish seal; Folded the writ up in form of the other, Subscrib’d it, gave ’t the impression,’ plac’d it safely, The changeling never known. Now, the next day Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent Thou know’st already. Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to ’t. Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment; They are not near my conscience. Their defeat Doth by their own insinuation grow.

HAMLET Ham. Does it not, thinks’t thee, stand me now upon—* He that hath kill’d my king and whor’d my mother, Popp’d in between the election and my hopes, Thrown out his angle for my proper” life, And with such cozenage’’—is ’t not perfect conscience, To quit him with this arm? And is ’t not to be damn’d, To let this canker of our nature come In further evil? Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there. Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine, And a man’s life’s no more than to say “One.” But I am very sorry, good Horatio That to Laertes I forgot myself; For, by the image of my cause, I see The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours. But, sure, the bravery” of his grief did put me Into a tow’ring passion. Hor. Peace! who comes here? Enter Young Osric Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark. Ham. 1 humbly thank you, sir—Dost know this waterfly? Hor. No, my good lord. 201 Ham. Thy state is the more gracious, for ’tis a vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile; let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the King’s mess. "Tis a chough,” but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt. Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from his Majesty. Ham. I will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; ’tis for the head. Osr. 1 thank your lordship, ’tis very hot. Ham. No, believe me, ’tis very cold; the wind is northerly. Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed. 131s it not my duty? Own. ' Deceit. 16 Ostentation. 17 Jackdaw.

202 SHAKESPEARE Ham. Methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion. Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,—as ’twere,—I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter,— Ham. I beseech you, remember— [Hamer moves him to put on his hat.) Osr. Nay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. [Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes, believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences,” of very soft society and great showing; indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card® or calendar™ of gentry, for you shall find in him the continent” of what part a gentleman would see. Ham. Sir, his definement” suffers no perdition® in you; though, I know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw™ neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article;* and his infusion of such dearth and rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his semblable”* is his mirror; and who else would trace him, his umbrage,” nothing more. Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him. Ham. The concernancy,” sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath? Osr. Sir? Hor. Is ’t not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do ’t, sir, really. Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman? Osr. Of Laertes? Hor. His purse is empty already. All ’s golden words are spent. Ham. Of him, sir. Osr. 1 know you are not ignorant— Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not much approve me. Well, sir? ] Osr.

That’s two of his weapons; but well. Osr. The King, sir, has wag’d with him six Barbary horses, against the which he has impon’d,” as J take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their assigns,” as girdle, hanger, or so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive” to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.” Ham. What call you the carriages? {Hor. I knew you must be edified by the margent™ ere you had done. } Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers. Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter, if we could carry cannon by our sides; I would it might be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages; that ’s the French bet against the Danish. Why is this “impon’d,” as you call it? Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between you and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath laid on twelve for nine; and that would come to immediate trial, if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer. Ham. How if I answer no? Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial. Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall; if it please his Majesty, tis the breathing™ time of day with me. Let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose, I will win for him if I can; if not, I'll gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits. Osr. Shall I re-deliver you e’en so? Ham. To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will. Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship. Ham. Yours, yours.

204 SHAKESPEARE Hor, This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head. Ham. He did comply®* with his dug before he suck’d it. Thus has he, and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed” opinions; and do but blow them to their trials, the bubbles are out. [Enter a Lord Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He . sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time. Ham. 1 am constant to my purposes; they follow the King’s pleasure. If his fitness speaks, mine is ready, now or whensoever, provided I be so able as now. Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down. Ham. In happy time. Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play. Ham. She well instructs me.] [Exit Lord.] Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord. Ham. 1 do not think so; since he went into France, I have been in continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all ’s here about my heart. But it is no matter. Hor. Nay, good my lord,— Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving,” as would perhaps trouble a woman. Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their repair hither, and say you are not fit. Ham. Not a whit; we defy augury. There’s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, ’tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come; the readiness is all. Since no man has aught of what he leaves,* what is ’t to leave betimes?

[The Kine puts Lasrtes’s hand into HaMter’s.} Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I’ve done you wrong, But pardon ’t, as you are a gentleman. This presence” knows, And you must needs have heard, how I am punish’d With sore distraction. What I have done That might your nature, honour, and exception” Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness. Was ’t Hamlet wrong’d Laertes? Never Hamlet! If Hamlet from himself be ta’en away, And when he’s not himself does wrong Leertes, Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it. Who does it, then? His madness. If ’t be so, Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong’d; His madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy. Sir, in this audience, Let my disclaiming from a purpos’d evil Free me so far in your most generous thoughts, That I have shot mine arrow o’er the house And hurt my brother. Laer. T am satisfied in nature, Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most To my revenge; but in my terms of honour T stand aloof, and will no reconcilement, Till by some elder masters of known honour I have a voice and precedent of peace, To keep my name ungor’d.” But till that time, I do receive your offer’d love like love, And will not wrong it.

No, by this hand. King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet, You know the wager? Ham. Very well, my lord. Your Grace hath laid the odds o’ the weaker side. King. 1 do not fear it, I have seen you both; But since he is better’d, we have therefore odds. Laer. This is too heavy, let me see another. Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length? They prepare to play. Osr. Ay, my good lord. King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table. If Hamlet give the first or second hit, Or quit in answer of the third exchange, Let all the battlements their ordnance fire. The King shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath, And in the cup an union® shall he throw, Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark’s crown have worn.

THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE

INTRODUCTORY NOTE “Kine Lear” is, in its picture of the tragic effect of human weakness and human cruelty, the most overpowering of the works of Shakespeare. It was written about 1605, in the middle of that period of his activity when he was interested, for whatever reason, in portraying the suffering and disaster that are entailed by defects of character, and the terrible cost at which such defects are purged away; and not even “Hamlet” displays these things so irresistibly. The germ of the story is found in the folk-lore of many ages and countries. Attached to the name of Lear, the legend assumed pseudohistorical form with Geoffrey of Monmouth in the twelfth century, was handed down through the long line of Latin and English chroniclers, appeared in collections of tales, found a place in Spenser’s “Faerie Queene,” and was dramatized by an anonymous playwright about ten years before the date of Shakespeare’s drama. To Shakespeare himself is due the tragic catastrophe which takes the place of the traditional fortunate ending, according to which the French forces were victorious, and Lear was restored to his kingdom. He first makes Lear go mad; invents the banishment of Kent and his subsequent disguise; creates the Fool; and, finally, connects with Lear the whole story of Gloucester and his sons. This skilfully interwoven underplot is taken from Sidney’s “Arcadia,” in which a story is told of a king turned against his legitimate son by the slanders of his bastard. The pretended madness of Edgar, and the love of the wicked daughters for Edmund are inventions of Shakespeare’s. But these details are not the only means by which the improbable legend is converted into the most tremendous of tragedies. This is done chiefly by the intensity with which the characters are conceived: the imperiousness and intellectual grasp of Lear, the force and subtlety of Edmund, the venom of the wicked daughters, the tenderness of Cordelia, the impassioned loyalty of Kent, the unselfishness of Edgar, and the poignant candor of the faithful Fool.

I love your Majesty According to my bond; no more nor less. Lear. How, how, Cordelia! Mend your speech a little, Lest you may mar your fortunes. Cor. Good my lord, You have begot me, bred me, lov’d me: I Return those duties back as are right fit; Obey you, love you, and most honour you. Why have my sisters husbands, if they say They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed, That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry Half my love with him, half my care and duty. Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters [To love my father all]. Lear.

Here’s France and Burgundy, my noble lord. Lear. My Lord of Burgundy, We first address toward you, who with this king Hath rivall’d for our daughter. What, in the least, Will you require in present dower with her, Or cease your quest of love? Bur. Most royal Majesty, I crave no more than what your Highness offer’d, Nor will you tender less. Lear. Right noble Burgundy, When she was dear to us, we did hold her so; But now her price is fallen. Sir, there she stands: If aught within that little-seeming substance, Or all of it, with our displeasure piec’d, And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace, She’s there, and she is yours. Bur. I know no answer. Lear. Will you, with those infirmities she owes,” Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate, Dower’d with our curse, and stranger’d with our oath, Take her, or leave her? 20 Owns.

222 SHAKESPEARE Bur. Pardon me, royal sir; Election makes not up” in such conditions. Lear. Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me, I tell you all her wealth. [To France.] For you, great king, I would not from your love make such a stray, To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you To avert your liking a more worthier way Than on a wretch whom Nature is asham’d Almost to acknowledge hers. France. This is most strange, That she, whom even but now was your best object, The argument” of your praise, balm of your age, The best, the dearest, should in this trice of time Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence Must be of such unnatural degree, That monsters” it, or your fore-vouch’d affection Fallen into taint; which to believe of her, Must be a faith that reason without miracle Should never plant in me. Cor. ' Tyet beseech your Majesty,— If for I want that glib and oily art, To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend, Y'll do ’t before I speak,— that you make known It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness, No unchaste action, or dishonoured step, That hath depriv’d me of your grace and favour; But even for want of that for which I am richer, A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue That I am glad I have not, though not to have it Hath lost me in your liking. Lear. Better thou Hadst not been born than not to have pleas’d me better. France. Is it but this,—a tardiness in nature Which often leaves the history“ unspoke That it intends to do?

KING LEAR 223 What say you to the lady? Love’s not love When it is mingled with regards* that stand Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her? She is herself a dowry. Bur. Royal king, Give but that portion which yourself propos’d, And here I take Cordelia by the hand, Duchess of Burgundy. Lear. Nothing. I have sworn; I am firm. Bur. 1am sorry, then, you have so lost a father That you must lose a husband. Cor. Peace be with Burgundy! Since that respect and fortunes are his love, I shall not be his wife. France. Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich being poor, Most choice forsaken, and most lov’d despis’d! Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon, Be it lawful I take up what’s cast away. Gods, gods! ’tis strange that from their cold’st neglect My love should kindle to inflam’d respect. Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance, Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France. Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy Can buy this unpriz’d precious maid of me. Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind; Thou losest here, a better where” to find. Lear. Thou hast her, France. Let her be thine; for we Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see That face of hers again—[To Cor.] Therefore be gone Without our grace, our love, our benison.”— Come, noble Burgundy. Flourish.

Sister, it is not little I] have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both. I think our father will hence to-night. Reg. That’s most certain, and with you; next month with us. Gon. You see how full of changes his age is; the observation we have made of it hath not been little. He always lov’d our sister most; and with what poor judgement he hath now cast her off appears too grossly.” Reg. "Tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself. Gon. The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then must we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed condition,” but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them. Reg. Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent’s banishment. Gon. There is further compliment of leave-taking between France and him. Pray you, let us hit together; if our father carry authority with such disposition as he bears, this last surrender of his will but offend us. 28 Professing. 29 Advance. %°Deserve. 3!

Come, if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles. Edm. I beseech you, sir, pardon me.

I hope, for my brother’s justification, he wrote this but as an essay® or taste of my virtue. Glou. (Reads.) “This policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to the best of our ‘times; keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways, not as it hath power, but as it is suffer’d. Come to me, that of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I wak’d him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your brother, Enpcar.” Hum—conspiracy!—“Sleep till I wake him, you should enjoy half his revenue!”—My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain to breed it in?—When came this to you? Who brought it? Edm. It was not brought me, my lord; there’s the cunning of it. I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet. Glou. You know the character to be your brother’s? Edm. If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his; but, in respect of that, I would fain think it were not. Glou. It is his. 8 Trial.

KING LEAR 227 Edm. It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the contents. Glou. Has he never before sounded you in this business? Edm. Never, my lord; but I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declin’d, the father should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue. Glou. O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him; I'll apprehend him. Abominable villain! Where is he? Edm. 1 do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain course; where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life for him, that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your honour, and to no other pretence of danger. Glou. Think you so? Edm. If your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction; and that without any further delay than this very evening.

These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourg’d by the sequent effects.

228 SHAKESPEARE father. This villain of mine comes under the prediction; there’s son against father; the King falls from bias of nature;” there’s father against child. We have seen the best of our time; machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it carefully. And the noble and true-hearted Kent banish’d! his offence, honesty! ’Tis strange. Exit. Edm. This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in fortune,—often the surfeits’® of our own behaviour,—we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as if we were villains on necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance, drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforc’d obedience of planetary influence, and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition on the charge of a star! My father compounded with my mother under the dragon’s tail; and my nativity was under Ursa Major; so that it follows, I am rough and lecherous. Fut, I should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the ‘firmament twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar— Enter Epcar and pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old comedy.

Edm. 1am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day, what should follow these eclipses. Edg. Do you busy yourself with that? Edm. I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily; [as of unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and maledictions against king and nobles; needless diffidences,* banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches and I know not what. 12 Natural inclination, 1% Bad effects. 4A crazy beggar.

Edm. Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him by word nor countenance? Edg. None at all. Edm. Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him; and at my entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure, which at this instant so rageth in him, that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay. Edg. Some villain hath done me wrong. Edm. That’s my fear. I pray you, have a continent” forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak. Pray ye, go; there’s my key. If you do stir abroad, go arm’d. Edg. Arm’d, brother! Edm. Brother, I advise you to the best; go armed; I am no honest man if there be any good meaning toward you. I have told you what I have seen and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image and horror of it. Pray you, away. Edg. Shall I hear from you anon? Edm. 1 do serve you in this business. Exit Encar.

I had rather be any kind o’ thing than a Fool; and yet I would not be thee, nuncle; thou hast pared thy wit o’ both sides, and left nothing i’ the middle. Here comes one o’ the parings. Enter GoneERIL Lear. How now, daughter! what makes that frontlet® on? [Methinks] you are too much of late i’ the frown. Fool. Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for her frowning; now thou art an O without a figure. I am better than thou art now; I am a Fool, thou art nothing. [To Gon.] Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue; so your face bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum, “He that keeps nor crust nor crumb, Weary of all, shall want some.” [Pointing to Lear.] That’s a sheal’d“* peascod. 3 The scowl on her brow. 'Empty.

236 SHAKESPEARE Gon. Not only, sir, this your all-licens’d Fool, But other of your insolent retinue Do hourly carp’ and quarrel, breaking forth In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir, I had thought, by making this well known unto you, To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful, By what yourself, too, late have spoke and done, That you protect this course, and put it on” By your allowance; which if you should, the fault Would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep, Which, in the tender’ of a wholesome weal, Might in their working do you that offence, Which else were shame, that then necessity Will call discreet proceeding. Fool. For, you know, nuncle, “The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long, That it had it head bit off by it young.” So, out went the candle, and we were left darkling.” Lear, Are you our daughter? Gon. [Come, sir,] I would you would make use of your good wisdom, Whereof I know you are fraught,” and put away These dispositions, which of late transport you From what you rightly are. Fool. May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse? “Whoop, Jug! I love thee.” Lear. Doth any here know me? This is not Lear. Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes? Either his notion weakens, his discernings Are lethargied—Ha! waking? "Tis not so. Who is it that can tell me who I am? Fool. Lear’s shadow. [ Lear. I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty, knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded I had daughters. Fool. Which they will make an obedient father.] Lear. Your name, fair gentlewoman? 15 Find fault. ‘Encourage it. 17 Regard, care. 18In the dark. 19 Endowed.

KING LEAR 237 Gon. This admiration,” sir, is much o’ the savour Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you To understand my purposes aright. As you are old and reverend, you should be wise. Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires; Men so disorder’d, so debosh’d” and bold, That this our court, infected with their manners, Shows like a riotous inn. Epicurism” and lust Makes it more like a tavern or a brothel Than a grac’d palace. The shame itself doth speak For instant remedy. Be then desir’d By her, that else will take the thing she begs, A little to disquantity® your train; And the remainders, that shall still depend, To be such men as may besort™ your age, Which know themselves and you. Lear. Darkness and devils! Saddle my horses; call my train together! Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee; Yet have I left a daughter. Gon. You strike my people; and your disorder’d rabble Make servants of their betters. Enter ALBANY Lear. Woe, that too late repents!—[O, sir, are you come? ] Is it your will? Speak, sir—Prepare my horses.— Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend, More hideous when thou show’st thee in a child Than the sea-monster! Alb, Pray, sir, be patient. Lear. [To Gon.] Detested kite! thou liest. My train are men of choice and rarest parts, That all particulars of duty know, And in the most exact regard support The worships” of their name. O most small fault, 20Pretended wonder. 2! Debauched. ?%Gluttony. 23 Reduce. 24Suit. 25 Honor.

238 SHAKESPEARE How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show! Which, like an engine,” wrench’d my frame of nature From the fix’d place; drew from my heart all love, And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear! Beat at this gate, that let thy folly in, [Striking his head.| And thy dear judgement out! Go, go, my people. Alb. My lord, I am guiltless as I am ignorant Of what hath moved you. Lear. It may be so, my lord. Hear, Nature! hear, dear goddess, hear! Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend To make this creature fruitful! Into her womb convey sterility! Dry up in her the organs of increase, And from her derogate” body never spring A babe to honour her! If she must teem,” Create her child of spleen, that it may live And be a thwart” disnatur’d torment to her! Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth, With cadent® tears fret channels in her cheeks, Turn all her mother’s pains and benefits To laughter and contempt, that she may feel How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is To have a thankless child!—Away, away! Alb, Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this? Gon. Never afflict yourself to know more of it; But let his disposition have that scope As dotage gives it. Re-enter LEAR Lear. What, fifty of my followers at a clap! Within a fortnight! Alb, What’s the matter, sir? Exit. Lear. V'll tell thee. [To Gon.] Life and death! I am asham’d That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus; That these hot tears, which break from me perforce, 26 Rack. 27 Degraded. °8Have children. 29 Twisted in disposition. 30 Falling.

KING LEAR 239 Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee! The untented” woundings of a father’s curse Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond® eyes, Beweep this cause again, I’ll pluck ye out, And cast you, with the waters that you loose, To temper clay. Ha! [is it come to this? ] Let it be so: I have another daughter, Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable. When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think I have cast off for ever. [Thou shalt, I warrant thee.] [Exeunt Lear, Kent, and Attendants. ] Gon. Do you mark that? Alb. 1 cannot be so partial, Goneril, To the great love I bear you,— Gon. Pray you, content.—Whiat, Oswald, ho! [To the Fool.| You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master. Fool. Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry! Take the Fool with thee. A fox, when one has caught her, And such a daughter, Should sure to the slaughter, If my cap would buy a halter. So the Fool follows after. Exit. Gon. This man hath had good counsel,—a hundred knights! *Tis politic and safe to let him keep At point® a hundred knights; yes, that, on every dream, Each buzz,” each fancy, each complaint, dislike, He may enguard his dotage with their powers, And hold our lives in mercy. Oswald, I say! Alb. Well, you may fear too far. Gon. Safer than trust too far. Let me still take away the harms I fear, Not fear still to be taken. I know his heart. What he hath utter’d I have writ my sister. 31Too deep to be probed. %2 Foolish. 3 Fully armed. 34 Idle rumor.

240 SHAKESPEARE If she sustain him and his hundred knights, When I have show’d the unfitness,— Re-enter Steward [Oswatp] How now, Oswald! What, have you writ that letter to my sister? Osw. Ay, madam. Gon. Take you some company, and away to horse. Inform her full of my particular fear; And thereto add such reasons of your own As may compact® it more. Get you gone; And hasten your return. [Exit Oswatp.] No, no, my lord, This milky gentleness and course of yours Though I condemn not, yet, under pardon, You are much more at task®* for want of wisdom Than prais’d for harmful mildness. Alb. How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell. Striving to better, oft we mar what’s well. Gon. Nay, then— Alb, Well, well; the event. Exeunt. Scene V. [Court before the same] Enter Lear, Kent, and Fool Lear. Go you before to Gloucester with these letters. Acquaint my daughter no further with anything you know than comes from her demand out of the letter. If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore you. Kent. I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered your letter. Exit. Fool. If a man’s brains were in ’s heels, were ’t not in danger of kibes?* Lear. Ay, boy. Fool. Then, I prithee, be merry; thy wit shall not go slip-shod. Lear. Ha, ha, ha! 35 Confirm. %°To be blamed. ! Chilblains.

KING LEAR 241 Fool. Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly;? for though she’s as like this as a crab’s like an apple, yet I can tell what I can tell. Lear, What canst tell, boy? Fool. She will taste as like this as a crab does to a ia Thou canst tell why one’s nose stands i’ the middle on ’s face? Lear. No. Fool. Why, to keep one’s eyes of either side ’s nose, that what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into. Lear. 1 did her wrong— Fool. Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell ? Lear. No. Fool. Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house. Lear. Why? Fool. Why, to put ’s head in; not to give it away to his daughters, and leave his horns without a case. Lear. I will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be my horses ready? Fool. Thy asses are gone about ’em. The reason why the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason. Lear. Because they are not eight? Fool. Yes, indeed. Thou wouldst make a good Fool. Lear. To take ’t again perforce!* Monster ingratitude! Fool. If thou wert my Fool, nuncle, I’d have thee beaten for being old before thy time. Lear. How’s that? Fool. Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise. Lear. O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven! Keep me in temper; I would not be mad! [Enter Gentleman | How now! are the horses ready? Gent. Ready, my lord. Lear. Come, boy. Fool. She that’s a maid now, and laughs at my departure, Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter. Exeunt, 2 A pun: with kindness, and after her kind. 3 Probably Lear is thinking of regaining his power.

242 SHAKESPEARE ACT II Scene I. [The Earl of Gloucester’s castle] Enter Bastard [EpMunb] and Curan, severally Edm. Save thee, Curan. Cur. And you, sir. I have been with your father, and given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his duchess will be here with him this night. Edm. How comes that? Cur. Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad; I mean the whisper’d ones, for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments?" Edm. Not I. Pray you, what are they? Cur. Have you heard of no likely wars toward,’ ’twixt the Dukes of Cornwall and Albany? Edm. Not a word. Cur. You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir. Exit. Edm. The Duke be here to-night? The better! best! This weaves itself perforce into my business. My father hath set guard to take my brother; And I have one thing, of a queasy question,’ Which I must act. Briefness* and fortune, work! Enter Epcar Brother, a word; descend. Brother, I say! My father watches; O sir, fly this place; Intelligence is given where you are hid; You have now the good advantage of the night. Have you not spoken ’gainst the Duke of Cornwall? He’s coming hither, now, i’ the night, i’ the haste, And Regan with him. Have you nothing said Upon his party ’gainst the Duke of Albany? Advise yourself.’ Edg. I am sure on ’t, not a word. Edm. I hear my father coming. Pardon me, 1 Subjects of discussion. 2 Coming on. 3 Requiring delicate handling. 4Speed. 5 Reflect.

KING LEAR 243 In cunning I must draw my sword upon you. Draw; seem to defend yourself; now quit you well. Yield! Come before my father. Light, ho, here!— Fly, brother.—Torches, torches!—So, farewell. Exit Encar. Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion [Wounds his arm.] Of my more fierce endeavour. I have seen drunkards Do more than this in sport—Father, father!— Stop, stop!—No help? Enter Gioucester, and Servants with torches Glou. Now, Edmund, where’s the villain? Edm. Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out, Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon To stand auspicious mistress,— Glou. But where is he? Edm. Look, sit, I bleed. Glou. Where is the villain, Edmund? Edm. Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could— Glou. Pursue him, ho! Go after. [Exeunt some Servants.] By no means what? Edm. Persuade me to the murder of your lordship; But that I told him, the revenging gods ’Gainst parricides did all the thunder bend; Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine, Seeing how loathly opposite I stood To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,’ With his prepared sword, he charges home My unprovided body, latch’d’ mine arm; And when he saw my best alarum’d spirits, Bold in the quarrel’s right, rous’d to the encounter, Or whether gasted® by the noise I made, Full suddenly he fled. Glou. Let him fly far. Not in this land shall he remain uncaught; And found,—dispatch. The noble Duke my master, 6 With a formidable thrust. 7 Caught, hit. ° Frightened.

244 SHAKESPEARE My worthy arch’ and patron, comes to-night. By his authority I will proclaim it, That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks, Bringing the murderous coward to the stake; He that conceals him, death. Edm. When I dissuaded him from his intent, And found him pight”® to do it, with curst speech I threaten’d to discover” him; he replied, “Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think, If I would stand against thee, would the reposal Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee Make thy words faith’d?” No! what I should deny,— As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce My very character,“—I’d turn it all To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice; And thou must make a dullard of the world® If they not thought the profits of my death Were very pregnant and potential spurs’® To make thee seek it.” Glou. O strange and fast’ned” villain! Would he deny his letter? [I never got him.] Tucket within. Hark, the Duke’s trumpets! I know not why he comes. All ports I'll bar, the villain shall not scape; The Duke must grant me that. Besides, his picture I will send far and near, that all the kingdom May have due note of him; and of my land, Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means To make thee capable.” Enter Cornwatt, Recan, and Attendants Corn. How now, my noble friend! since I came hither, Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news. Reg. If it be true, all vengeance comes too short Which can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord?

KING LEAR 245 Reg. What, did my father’s godson seek your life? He whom my father nam’d? your Edgar? Glou. O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid! Reg. Was he not companion with the riotous knights That tended upon my father? Glou. 1 know not, madam. ’Tis too bad, too bad. Edm. Yes, madam, he was of that consort.” Reg. No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:” *Tis they have put him on the old man’s death, To have the expense and waste of his revenues. I have this present evening from my sister Been well inform’d of them; and with such cautions, That if they come to sojourn at my house, I'll not be there. Corn. Nor I, assure thee, Regan. Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father A child-like office. Edm. *Twas my duty, sir. Glou. He did bewray his practice;” and-receiv’d This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him. Corn. Is he pursued? Glou. Ay, my good lord. Corn. If he be taken, he shall never more Be fear’d of doing harm. Make your own purpose, How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund, Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant So much commend itself, you shall be ours. Natures of such deep trust we shall much need; You we first seize on. Edm. I shall serve you, sir, Truly, however else. Glou. For him I thank your Grace. Corn. You know not why we came to visit you,— Reg. Thus out of season, threading dark-ey’d night? Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,” Wherein we must have use of your advice. Band. *Disloyal. 2! Reveal his plot. 22 Weight.

Kent. l the mire. Osw. Prithee, if thou lov’st me, tell me. Kent. I love thee not. Osw. Why, then, I care.not for thee. Kent. If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee care for me. Osw. Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not. Kent. Fellow, 1 know thee. Osw. What dost thou know me for? Kent. A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited," hundred-pound, filthy, worstedstocking knave; a lily-livered, action-taking, whoreson, glass-gazing, superserviceable, finical rogue; one-trunk-inheriting’ slave; one that wouldst be a bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar, and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch; one whom I will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deni’st the least syllable of thy addition? Osw. Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee! 23 Away from. 24 Wait to be sent off. ! Three suits of clothing seem to have been part of a servant’s allowance. 2 All of whose goods go into one trunk, 3 Title.

KING LEAR 247 Kent. What a brazen-fac’d varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest me! Is it two days since I tripp’d up thy heels, and beat thee before the King? Draw, you rogue; for, though it be night, yet the moon shines. I'll make a sop o’ the moonshine of you, you whoreson cullionly* barber-monger!* Draw! [Drawing his sword.| Osw. Away! I have nothing to do with thee. Kent. Draw, you rascal! You come with letters against the King; and take Vanity the puppet’s part against the royalty of her father. Draw, you rogue, or I’ll so carbonado® your shanks—draw, you rascal! Come your ways. Osw. Help, ho! murder! help! Kent. Strike, you slave! Stand, rogue, stand! You neat slave, strike. | Beating him.| Osw. Help, ho! murder! murder! Enter Bastard [EpMunp] with his rapier drawn, CorNwaLt, Recan, GLoucesTER, and Servants Edm. How now! What's the matter? Part. Kent. With you, goodman boy,’ if you please. Come, I'll flesh* ye; come on, young master. Glou. Weapons! arms! What's the matter here? Corn. Keep peace, upon your lives! He dies that strikes again. What is the matter? Reg. The messengers from our sister and the King. Corn. What is your difference? Speak. Osw. 1 am scarce in breath, my lord. Kent. No marvel, you have so bestirr’d your valour. You cowardly rascal, Nature disclaims in’ thee. A tailor made thee. Corn. Thou art a strange fellow. A tailor make a man? Kent. A tailor, sir. A stone-cutter or a painter could not have made him so ill, though they had been but two years o’ the trade. Corn. Speak yet, how grew your quarrel? Osw. This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spar’d at suit of his grey beard,— Kent. Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary” letter! My lord, 4Rascally. 5 Haunter of barber-shops. 8Slash. 7Little master. 8 Initiate. 9Disavows. '° Z was often omitted from the old dictionaries,

248 SHAKESPEARE if you will give me leave, I will tread this unbolted" villain into mortar, and daub the wall of a jakes with him. Spare my grey beard, you wagtail? Corn. Peace, sirrah! You beastly knave, know you no reverence? Kent. Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege. Corn. Why art thou angry? Kent. That such a slave as this should wear a sword, Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these, Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain Which are too intrinse” to unloose; smooth every passion That in the natures of their lords rebel; Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods; Renege,’* affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks"* With every gale and vary of their masters, Knowing nought, like dogs, but following. A plague upon your epileptic visage! Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool? Goose, if I had you upon Sarum Plain, I'd drive ye cackling home to Camelot. Corn, What, art thou mad, old fellow? Glou. How fell you out? Say that. Kent. No contraries hold more antipathy Than I and such a knave. Corn. Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault? Kent. His countenance likes me not. Corn. No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers. Kent. Sir, ’tis my occupation to be plain; I have seen better faces in my time Than stands on any shoulder that I see Before me at this instant. Corn. This is some fellow Who, having been prais’d for bluntness, doth affect A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb” Quite from his nature. He cannot flatter, he; 1 Rank. }2 Intricate. 13 Deny. 4 The halcyon or kingfisher was hung up and used as a weather-cock. 1 Pleases. 16 Puts on forcibly a manner not natural to him.

KING LEAR 249 An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth! An” they will take it, so; if not, he’s plain. These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends Than twenty silly ducking observants™ That stretch their duties nicely.’ Kent. Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity, Under the allowance of your great aspect, Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire On flickering Phebus’ front,— Corn. What mean’st by this? Kent. To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I know, sir, Iam no flatterer. He that beguil’d you in a plain accent was a plain knave; which for my part I will not be, though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to ’t. Corn. What was the offence you gave him? Osw. I never gave him any. It pleas’d the King his master very late To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;. When he, compact,” and flattering his displeasure, Tripp’d me behind; being down, insulted,” rail’d, And put upon him such a deal of man” That ’t worthied” him, got praises of the King For him attempting“ who was self-subdued; And, in the fleshment” of this dread exploit, Drew on me here again. Kent. None of these rogues and cowards But Ajax is their fool. Corn. Fetch forth the stocks! You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart, We'll teach you— Kent. Sir, I am too old to learn. Call not your stocks for me; I serve the King, On whose employment I was sent to you. - You shall do small respects, show too bold malice WI, 18 Obsequious servants. 19Carry out their duties very punctiliously. 20'Taking his part. 2!

Till night, my lord; and all night too. Kent. Why, madam, if I were your father’s dog, You should not use me so. Reg. Sir, being his knave, I will. Stocks brought out. Corn. This is a fellow of the self-same colour® Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks! Glou. Let me beseech your Grace not to do so. [His fault is much, and the good King his master Will check him for ’t. Your purpos’d low correction Is such as basest and contemned’st wretches For pilferings and most common trespasses Are punish’d with.] The King must take it ill That he’s so slightly valued in his messenger, Should have him thus restrained. Corn. T'll answer that. Reg. My sister may receive it much more worse To have her gentleman abus’d, assaulted, [For following her affairs. Put in his legs.] [Kent 1s put in the stocks.| Come, my good lord, away. Exeunt [all but Guoucester and Kent]. Glou. I am sorry for thee, friend; ’tis the Duke’s pleasure, Whose disposition, all the world well knows, Will not be rubb’d” nor stopp’d. Pll entreat for thee. Kent. Pray, do not, sir. I have watch’d and travell’d hard; Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle. A good man’s fortune may grow out at heels. Give you good morrow! Glou.

As I learn’d, The night before there was no purpose in them Of this remove. Kent. Hail to thee, noble master! Lear. Ha] Mak’st thou this shame thy pastime? Kent. No, my lord. Fool. Ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by the loins, and men by the legs. When a man’s over-lusty at legs, then he wears wooden netherstocks.’ Lear. What’s he that hath so much thy place mistook To set thee here? Kent. It is both he and she; Your son and daughter. Lear, No. Kent. Yes. Lear, No, I say. Kent. I say, yea. [Lear. No, no, they would not. Kent. Yes, they have.] Lear. By Jupiter, I swear, no. Kent. By Juno, I swear, ay. Lear.

KING LEAR 253 Resolve’ me, with all modest haste, which way Thou mightst deserve, or they impose, this usage, Coming from us. Kent. My lord, when at their home I did commend‘ your Highness’ letters to them, Ere I was risen from the place that show’d My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post, Stew’d in his haste, half breathless, panting forth From Goneril, his mistress, salutations; Deliver’d letters, spite of intermission,’ Which presently they read. On those contents, They summon’d up their meiny,’ straight took horse; Commanded me to follow, and attend The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks: And meeting here the other messenger, Whose welcome, I perceiv’d, had poison’d mine,— Being the very fellow which of late Display’d’ so saucily against your Highness,— Having more man than wit about me, drew. He rais’d the house with loud and coward cries. Your son and daughter found this trespass worth The shame which here it suffers. Fool. Winter’s not gone yet, if the wild geese fly that way. “Fathers that wear rags Do make their children blind; But fathers that bear bags Shall see their children kind.

An thou hadst been set i’ the stocks for that question, thou’dst well deserv’d it. Kent. Why, Fool? Fool. We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there’s no labouring 1’ the winter. All that follow their noses are led by their eyes but blind men; and there’s not a nose among twenty but can smell him that’s stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with following; but the great one that goes upward, let him draw thee after. When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine again; I would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it. “That sir which serves and seeks for gain, And follows but for form, Will pack when it begins to rain, And leave thee in the storm. But I will tarry; the Fool will stay, And let the wise man fly. The knave turns fool that runs away; The Fool no knave, perdy.” Re-enter Lear and GLoucEsTER Kent. Where learn’d you this, Fool? Fool. Not i’ the stocks, fool. Lear. Deny to speak with me? They are sick? They are weary? They have travell’d all the night? Mere fetches; The images” of revolt and flying off. Fetch me a better answer. Glou. My dear lord, You know the fiery quality of the Duke; How unremovable and fix’d he is In his own course. 12 Subterfuges. 13 Signs.

KING LEAR 255 Lear, Vengeance! plague! death! confusion! “Fiery”? What “quality”? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester, I'd speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife. Glou. Well, my good lord, I have inform’d them so. Lear. “Inform’d” them! Dost thou understand me, man? Glou. Ay, my good lord. Lear. The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father Would with his daughter speak, commands her service. Are they “inform’d” of this? My breath and blood! “Fiery”? The fiery duke? Tell the hot duke that— No, but not yet; may be he is not well. Infirmity doth still neglect all office Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves When nature, being oppress’d, commands the mind To suffer with the body. I'll forbear; And am fallen out with my more headier"* will, To take the indispos’d and sickly fit For the sound man.—Death on my state! wherefore | Looking on Kent. | Should he sit here? This act persuades me That this remotion” of the Duke and her Is practice’ only. Give me my servant forth. Go tell the Duke and ’s wife I’'d speak with them, Now, presently.” Bid them come forth and hear me, Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum Till it cry sleep to death. Glou. I would have all well betwixt you. Exit. Lear. O me, my heart, my rising heart! But, down! Fool. Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when she put ’em i’ the paste alive; she knapp’d ’em o’ the coxcombs with a stick, and cried, “Down, wantons, down!” ’Twas her brother that, in pure kindness to his horse, buttered his hay. Enter Cornwati, Recan, Gioucester, and Servants Lear. Good morrow to you both. Corn. Hail to your Grace! 4More impetuous. 15 Seclusion. %8Craft. !7 At once.

256 SHAKESPEARE Kent is set at liberty. Reg. I am glad to see your Highness. Lear. Regan, I think you are; I know what reason I have to think so. If thou shouldst not be glad, I would divorce me from thy mother’s tomb, Sepulchring an adulteress. [To Kenrt.] O, are you free? Some other time for that. Beloved Regan, Thy sister’s naught. O Regan, she hath tied Sharp-tooth’d unkindness, like a vulture, here. [Points to his heart.] I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe With how deprav'd a quality—O Regan! Reg. I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope You less know how to value her desert Than she to scant her duty. Lear. Say, how is that? Reg. I cannot think my sister in the least Would fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance She have restrain’d the riots of your followers, ’Tis on such ground, and.to such wholesome end, As clears her from all blame. Lear. My curses on her! Reg. O, sir, you are old; Nature in you stands on the very verge Of her confine. You should be rul’d and led By some discretion that discerns your state Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you, That to our sister you do make return; Say you have wrong’d her, sir. Lear. Ask her forgiveness? Do you but mark how this becomes the house:”* “Dear daughter, I confess that I am old; [ Kneeling. ] Age is unnecessary. On my knees I beg That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.” Reg. Good sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks. Return you to my sister. 18 Family relation.

KING LEAR 257 Lear. [Rising.] Never, Regan: She hath abated” me of half my train; Look’d black upon me; struck me with her tongue, Most serpent-like, upon the very heart. All the stor’d vengeances of heaven fall On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones, You taking” airs, with lameness! Corn. Fie, sir, fie! Lear. You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty, You fen-suck’d fogs, drawn by the powerful sun, To fall** and blast her pride! Reg. O the blest gods! so will you wish on me, When the rash mood is on. Lear, No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse. Thy tender-hefted” nature shall not give Thee o’er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce; but thine Do comfort and not burn. ’Tis not in thee To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train, To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,” And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt Against my coming in. Thou better know’ The offices of nature, bond of childhood, Effects” of courtesy, dues of gratitude. Thy half 0’ the kingdom hast thou not forgot, Wherein J thee endow’d. Reg. Good sir, to the purpose. Tucket within Lear. Who put my man ?’ the stocks? Enter Steward [Oswatp] Corn. What trumpet’s that? Reg. I know ’t; my sister’s. This approves” her letter, That she would soon be here. [To Oswatp.] Is your lady come? 19Deprived. Infectious. 2! Humble. 22Gently disposed. 23 Allowances. 24 Workings. 5 Confirms.

258 SHAKESPEARE Lear. This is a slave whose easy-borrowed pride Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows. Out, varlet, from my sight! Corn. What means your Grace? Enter GonERIL Lear. Who stock’d my servant? Regan, I have good hope Thou didst not know on ’t. Who comes here? O heavens, If you do love old men, if your sweet sway Allow” obedience, if you yourselves are old, Make it your cause; send down, and take my part! [To Gon.] Art not asham’d to look upon this beard? O Regan, will you take her by the hand? Gon. Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended? All’s not offence that indiscretion finds And dotage terms so. Lear. O sides, you are too tough; Will you yet hold? How came my man i’ the stocks? Corn. 1 set him there, sir; but his own disorders Deserv’d much less advancement. Lear. You! did you? Reg. I pray you, father, being weak, seem so If, till the expiration of your month, You will return and sojourn with my sister, Dismissing half your train, come then to me. I am now from home, and out of that provision Which shall be needful for your entertainment. Lear, Return to her, and fifty men dismiss’d! No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose To wage” against the enmity o’ the air; To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,— Necessity’s sharp pinch. Return with her? Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took Our youngest born, I could as well be brought To knee” his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg 26 Approve of. 27 Contend. 28 Kneel before.

KING LEAR 259 To keep base life afoot. Return with her? Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter™” To this detested groom. [ Pointing at Oswatn.] Gon. At your choice, sir. Lear. 1 prithee, daughter, do not make me mad; I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell! We'll no more meet, no more see one another. But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter; Or rather a disease that’s in my flesh, Which I must needs call mine; thou art a boil, A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle, In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee; Let shame come when it will, I do not call it. I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot, Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove. Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure. I can be patient; I can stay with Regan, I and my hundred knights, Reg. Not altogether so; I look’d not for you yet, nor am provided For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sisters For those that mingle reason with your passion Must be content to think you old, and so— But she knows what she does. Lear. Is this well spoken? Reg. I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers! Is it not well? What should you need of more? Yea, or so many, sith that both charge” and danger Speak ’gainst so great a number? How, in one house, Should many people, under two commands, Hold amity? ’Tis hard; almost impossible. Gon. Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance From those that she calls servants or from mine? Reg. Why not, my lord? If then they chanc’d to slack ye,’ We could control them. If you will come to me,— 29 Pack-horse (driver ?). 2°Swollen. 3! Expense. 32 Be slack in their performance of duties.

260 SHAKESPEARE For now I spy a danger—I entreat you To bring but five and twenty; to no more Will I give place or notice. Lear. I gave you all. Reg. And in good time you gave it. Lear, Made you my guardians, my depositaries;* But kept a reservation to be followed With such a number. What, must I come to you With five and twenty, Regan? Said you so? Reg. And speak ’t again, my lord; no more with me. Lear. Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour’d When others are more wicked; not being the worst Stands in some rank of praise. [To Gon.] I'll go with thee. Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty, And thou art twice her love. Gon. Hear me, my lord: What need you five and twenty, ten, or five, To follow in a house where twice so many Have a command to tend you? Reg. ; What need one? Lear. O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars Are in the poorest thing superfluous. Allow™ not nature more than nature needs, Man’s life is cheap as beast’s. Thou art a lady; If only to go warm were gorgeous, Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear’st, Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,— You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need! You see me here, you gods, a poor old man, As full of grief as age; wretched in both! If it be you that stirs these daughters’ hearts Against their father, fool me not so much To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger, And let not women’s weapons, water-drops, Stain my man’s cheeks! No, you unnatural hags, I will have such revenges on you both 33 Stewards and trustees. 341f you allow not.

KING LEAR 261 That all the world shall—I will do such things,— What they are, yet I know not; but they shall be The terrors of the earth. You think I’ll weep: No, I'll not weep. I have full cause of weeping; but this heart Storm and tempest. Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,* Or ere I'll weep. O, Fool! I shall go mad! Exeunt Lear, GioucestTer, Kent, and Fool. Corn. Let us withdraw; ’twill be a storm. Reg. This house is little; the old man and ’s people Cannot be well bestow’d.* Gon. "Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest, And must needs taste his folly. Reg. For his particular,” I'll receive him gladly, But not one follower. Gon. So am I purpos’d. Where is my Lord of Gloucester? Re-enter GLOUCESTER Corn. Followed the old man forth. He is return’d. Glou. The King is in high rage. Corn. Whither is he going? Glou. He calls to horse; but will I know not whither. Corn. ’Tis best to give him way; he leads himself. Gon. My lord, entreat him by no means to stay. Glou. Alack, the night comes on, and the high winds Do sorely ruffle;* for many miles about There’s scarce a bush. Reg. O, sir, to wilful men, The injuries that they themselves procure Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.

Poor Fool and knave, I have one part in my heart That’s sorry yet for thee.

Come, bring us to this hovel. Exeunt [Lear and Kent]. Fool. This is a brave night to cool a courtezan. I'll speak a prophecy ere I go: When priests are more in word than matter; When brewers mar their malt with water; When nobles are their tailors’ tutors; No heretics burn’d, but wenches’ suitors; When every case in law is right; No squire in debt, nor no poor knight; When slanders do not live in tongues; Nor cutpurses come not to throngs; When usurers tell their gold i’ the field; And bawds and whores do churches build: Then shall the realm of Albion Come to great confusion. Then comes the time, who lives to see ’t, That going shall be us’d with feet. This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time. Exit. 32 Refused to allow.

KING LEAR 267 Scene III. [Gloucester’s castle] Enter GLoucester and EpMunD Glou. Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing. When I desired their leave that I might pity him, they took from me the use of mine own house; charg’d me, on pain of perpetual displeasure, neither to speak of him, entreat for him, or any way sustain him. Edm. Most savage and unnatural! Glou. Go to; say you nothing. There is division between the Dukes, and a worse matter than that. I have received a letter this night; "tis dangerous to be spoken; I have lock’d the letter in my closet. These injuries the King now bears will be revenged home;' there is part of a power already footed.” We must incline to the King. I will look him, and privily relieve him. Go you and maintain talk with the Duke, that my charity be not of him perceived. If he ask for me, I am ill, and gone to bed. If I die for it, as no less is threat’ned me, the King my old master must be relieved. There is strange things toward,’ Edmund; pray you, be careful. Exit. Edm. This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the Duke Instantly know; and of that letter too. This seems a fair deserving,* and must draw me That which my father loses; no less than all. The younger rises when the old doth fall. Exit, Scenz IV. [The open country. Before a hovel] Enter Lear, Kent, and Fool Kent. Here is the place, my lord; good my lord, enter.

268 SHAKESPEARE Kent. I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter. Lear. Thou think’st ’tis much that this contentious storm Invades us to the skin; so ’tis to thee; But where the greater malady is fix’d, The lesser is scarce felt. Thou ’dst shun a bear; But if thy flight lay toward the roaring sea, Thou ’dst meet the bear i’ the mouth. When the mind’s free, The body’s delicate;’ the tempest in my mind Doth from my senses take all feeling else Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude! Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand For lifting food to ’t? But I will punish home. No, I will weep no more. In such a night To shut me out! Pour on! I will endure. In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril! Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all,— O, that way madness lies; let me shun that; No more of that. Kent. Good my lord, enter here. Lear, Prithee, go in thyself; seek thine own ease. This tempest will not give me leave to ponder On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in. [To the Fool.] In, boy; go first. You houseless poverty,— Nay, get thee in. I’ll pray, and then I’lll sleep. Exit [Fool]. Poor naked wretches, wheresoe’er you are, That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm, How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides, Your loop’d’ and window’d’ raggedness, defend you From seasons such as these? O, I have ta’en Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp; Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel, That thou mayst shake the superflux to them, And show the heavens more just. Edg.

[Enter Evcar, disguised as a madman] Edg. Away! the foul fiend follows me! “Through the sharp hawthorn blow the winds.” Hum! go to thy bed, and warm thee. Lear. Did’st thou give all to thy daughters, and art thou come to this? Edg. Who gives anything to poor Tom? whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame, and through ford and whirlpool, o’er bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow, and halters in his pew; set ratsbane’ by his porridge; made him proud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting-horse over four-inch’d bridges, to course his own shadow for a traitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom’s a-cold,—O, do de, do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds, starblasting, and taking!* Do poor Tom some charity, whom the foul fiend vexes. There could I have him now,—and there,—and there again, and there. Storm still, Lear. Has his daughters brought him to this pass? Couldst thou save nothing? Wouldst thou give ’em all? Fool. Nay, he reserv’d a blanket, else we had been all sham’d. Lear, Now, all the plagues that in the pendulous? air ‘Hang fated o’er men’s faults light on thy daughters! Kent. He hath no daughters, sir. Lear. Death, traitor! nothing could have subdu’d nature To such a lowness but his unkind daughters. Is it the fashion, that discarded fathers Should have thus little mercy on their flesh? Judicious punishment! ”Twas this flesh begot Those pelican® daughters.

270 SHAKESPEARE Fool. This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen. Edg. Take heed o’ the foul fiend. Obey thy parents; keep thy word justly; swear not; commit’ not with man’s sworn spouse; set not thy sweet heart on proud array. Tom ’s a-cold. Lear. What hast thou been? Edg. A serving-man, proud in heart and mind; that curl’d my hair; wore gloves in my cap; serv’d the lust of my mistress’ heart, and did the act of darkness with her; swore as many oaths as I spake words, and broke them in the sweet face of heaven: one that slept in the contriving of lust, and wak’d to do it. Wine lov’d I dearly, dice dearly; and in woman out-paramour’d the Turk:® false of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey. Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy foot out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets,? thy pen from lenders’ books, and defy the foul fiend. “Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind.” Says suum, mun, nonny. Dolphin my boy, boy, sessa! let him trot by. Storm still. Lear. Thou wert better in a grave than to answer” with thy uncover’d body this extremity of the skies. Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou ow’st the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! here’s three on ’s are sophisticated!

How fares your Grace? Lear. What’s he? Kent. Who's there? What is ’t you seek? Glou., What are you there? Your names? Edg. Poor Tom, that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the tadpole, the wall-newt, and the water; that in the fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages, eats cow-dung for salads; swallows the old rat and the ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle of the standing pool; who is whipp’d from tithing” to tithing, and stock’d punish’d, and imprison’d; who hath three suits to his back, six shirts to his body, Horse to ride, and weapon to wear; But mice and rats, and such small deer, Have been Tom’s food for seven long year.

It seem’d she was a queen Over her passion,’ who, most rebel-like, Sought to be king o’er her. Kent. O, then it mov’d her. Gent, Not to a rage; patience and sorrow strove Who should express her goodliest. You have seen Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears Were like a better way; those happy smilets That play’d on her ripe lip seem’d not to know What guests were in her eyes, which, parted thence, As pearls from diamonds dropp’d. In brief, Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved, If all could so become it. Kent. Made she no verbal question? Gent.

Her, (Reads.) “If any man of quality or decree within the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of Gloucester, that he is a manifold traitor, let him appear by the third sound of the trumpet. He is bold in his defence.” Edm. Sound! First trumpet. P Her, Again! Second trumpet. Her, Again! Third trumpet. Trumpet answers within. Enter Enear, at the third sound, armed, with a trumpet" before him. Alb. Ask him his purposes, why he appears Upon this call o’ the trumpet. Her. What are you? Your name, your quality? and why you answer This present summons? Edg. Know, my name is lost, By treason’s tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit;* 16 Your unaided strength. '7 Trumpeter. 18 Worm-eaten.

Draw thy sword, That, if my speech offend a noble heart, Thy arm may do thee justice; here is mine. Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours, My oath, and my profession. I protest, Maugre™ thy strength, place, youth, and eminence, Despite thy victor-sword and fire-hewn” fortune, Thy valour, and thy heart,” thou art a traitor; False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father; Conspirant ’gainst this high illustrious prince; And, from the extremest upward of thy head To the descent™ and dust below thy foot, A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou “No,” This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak, Thou liest. Edm. In wisdom I should ask thy name; But, since thy outside looks so fair and warlike, And that thy tongue some ’say™ of breeding breathes, What safe and nicely I might well delay, By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn. Back do I toss these treasons to thy head; With the hell-hated lie o’erwhelm thy heart; Which, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise, This sword of mine shall give them instant way, Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak! Alarums. They fight. [Epmunp falls.] Alb. Save him, save him! Gon. This is [mere] practice,” Gloucester. By the law of war thou wast not bound to answer Encounter. 79In spite of. 2!

Hold, sir— Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil. No tearing, lady; I perceive you know it. Gon. Say, if I do, the laws are mine, not thine. Who can arraign me for ’t? Alb. Most monstrous! oh!— Know’st thou this paper? Edm. Ask me not what I know. Alb, Go after her; she’s desperate; govern her. Edm. What you have charg’d me with, that have I done; And more, much more; the time will bring it out. *Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou That hast this fortune on me? If thou ’rt noble, I do forgive thee. Edg. Let’s exchange charity. I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund; If more, the more thou ’st wrong’d me. My name is Edgar, and thy father’s son. The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices Make instruments to plague us. The dark and vicious place where thee he got Cost him his eyes. Edm. Thou ’st spoken right, ’tis true. The wheel is come full circle; I am here. Alb. Methought thy very gait did prophesy A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee. Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I Did hate thee or thy father! Edg. Worthy prince, I know ’t. Alb, Where have you hid yourself? How have you known the miseries of your father? Edg. By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale; And when ’tis told, oh, that my heart would burst! 26 Opponent. 27 Cheated. [Exit.]

KING LEAR 313 The bloody proclamation to escape, That follow’d me so near,—oh, our lives’ sweetness! That we the pain of death would hourly die Rather than die at once!—taught me to shift Into a madman’s rags, to assume a semblance That very dogs disdain’d; and in this habit Met I my father with his bleeding rings, Their precious stones new lost; became his guide, Led him, begg’d for him, sav’d him from despair; Never,—O fault!—reveal’d myself unto him, Until some half-hour past, when I was arm’d. Not sure, though hoping, of this good success, I ask’d his blessing, and from first to last Told him our pilgrimage; but his flaw’d”*-heart, Alack, too weak the conflict to support! *Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief, Burst smilingly. Edm. This speech of yours hath mov’d me, And shall perchance do good. But speak you on; You look as you had something more to say. Alb, If there be more, more woeful, hold it in; For I am almost ready to dissolve,” Hearing of this. [Edg. This would have seem’d a period To such as love not sorrow; but another, To amplify too much, would make much more, And top extremity.” Whilst I was big® in clamour came there in a man, Who, having seen me in my worst estate, Shunn’d my abhorr’d society; but then, finding Who ’twas that so endur’d, with his strong arms He fastened on my neck, and bellowed out As he’d burst heaven; threw him on my father; Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him That ever ear received; which in recounting, His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life 28 Cracked. 29Melt in tears. 3° Surpass everything. 3! Loud.

314 SHAKESPEARE Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded, And there I left him tranc’d. Alb. But who was this? Edg. Kent, sir, the banish’d Kent; who in disguise Follow’d his enemy king, and did him service Improper for a slave.] Enter a Gentleman with a bloody knife Gent. Help, help, O, help? Edg. What kind of help? Alb, Speak, man. Edg. What means this bloody knife? Gent. ’Tis hot, it smokes; It came even from the heart of—O, she’s dead! Alb, Who dead? Speak, man. Gent. Your lady, sir, your lady; and her sister By her is poison’d; she confesses it. Edm. I was contracted to them both. All three Now marry in an instant. Edg. Here comes Kent. Enter Kent Alb, Produce the bodies, be they alive or dead. This judgement of the heavens, that makes us tremble, Touches us not with pity. [Exit Gentleman. ] —O, is this he? The time will not allow the compliment Which very manners urges. Kent. I am come To bid my king and master aye good-night. Is he not here? Alb, Great thing of us forgot! Speak, Edmund, where’s the King? and where’s Cordelia? The bodies of Gonerit and Recan are brought in. See’st thou this object,” Kent? Kent. Alack, why thus? 32 Sight.

To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send Thy token of reprieve. Edm. Well thought on. ‘Take my sword, Give it the captain. 315 Edg. Haste thee, for thy life. [Exit Gentleman.] Edm.

[Epmunp ¢s borne off.] Re-enter Lear, with Corvetia in his arms; [Gentleman following] Lear. Howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones! Had I your tongues and eyes, I’d use them so That heaven’s vault should crack. She’s gone for ever! I know when one is dead, and when one lives; She’s dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass; If that her breath will mist or stain the stone, Why, then she lives. Kent. Is this the promis’d end? Edg. Or image of that horror ?* Alb, Fall, and cease! Lear. This feather stirs; she lives! If it be so, It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows 33 Destroyed. 34 “Ts this the state of things foretold as the end of the world? Edg. Or only something resembling that fearful day?”—This is the usual interpretation.

I might have sav’d her; now she’s gone for ever! Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha! What is ’t thou say’st? Her voice was ever soft, Gentle, and low; an excellent thing in woman. I kill’d the slave that was a-hanging thee. Gent. Tis true, my lords, he did. Lear. Did I not, fellow? I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion I would have made him skip. I am old now, And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you? Mine eyes are not o’ the best. I'll tell you straight. Kent. If Fortune brag of two she lov’d and hated, One of them we behold. Lear, This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent? Kent. The same, Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius? Lear. He’s a good fellow, I can tell you that; He'll strike, and quickly too. He’s dead and rotten. Kent. No, my good lord; I am the very man,— Lear. V'll see that straight. Kent. That, from your first of difference and decay, Have follow’d your sad steps. Lear. You are welcome hither. Kent. Nor no man else; all’s cheerless, dark, and deadly. Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves, And desperately are dead. Lear. Ay, so I think. Alb, He knows not what he says; and vain is it That we present us to him. Enter a Messenger Edg. Very bootless, Mess. Edmund is dead, my lord.

KING LEAR 317 Alb. That’s but a trifle here. You lords and noble friends, know our intent. What comfort to this great decay* may come Shall be appli’d. For us, we will resign, During the life of this old majesty, To him our absolute power; [to Epcar and Kenrr] you, to your rights, With boot,® and such addition as your honours Have more than merited. All friends shall taste The wages of their virtue, and all foes The cup of their deservings. O, see, see! Lear. And my poor fool is hang’d! No, no, no life! Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life, And thou no breath at all? Thou’lt come no more, Never, never, never, never, never! Pray you, undo this button. Thank you, sir. Do you see this?

He hates him That would upon the rack of this tough world Stretch him out longer. Edg. He is gone, indeed. Kent. The wonder is he hath endur’d so long; He but usurp’d his life. Alb. Bear them from hence. Our present business Is general woe. [To Kent and Encar.] Friends of my soul, you twain Rule in this realm, and the gor’d®™ state sustain. Kent. 1 have a journey, sir, shortly to go. My master calls me; I must not say no. Edg. The weight of this sad time we must obey; Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say. The oldest hath borne most; we that are young Shall never see so much, nor live so long. Exeunt, with a dead march. 35 General disaster (7).

THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE

INTRODUCTORY NOTE Amonc the tragedies of Shakespeare, “Macbeth” is noted for the exceptional simplicity of the plot and the directness of the action. Here is no underplot to complicate or enrich, hardly more than a glimpse of humor to relieve the dark picture of criminal ambition, only the steady march toward an inevitable catastrophe. The story belongs to the half-legendary history of Scotland, and was drawn by Shakespeare from the “Chronicles of Holinshed.” For the most part, he follows the historian with considerable fidelity, but details such as the drugging of the grooms by Lady Macbeth, the portents described in the fourth scene of the second act, and the voice that called, “Sleep no more!” were suggested by other parts of the “Chronicle” than that dealing with the reigns of Duncan and Macbeth. Even the witches occur in Holinshed, who says: “The common opinion was that these women were either the weird sisters, that is (as ye would say) the goddesses of destiny, or else some nymphs or fairies, indued with knowledge of prophecy by their necromantical science.” While keeping this aspect of these figures as Fates, Shakespeare added details from the witch lore of his time, and made them capable of a symbolical and spiritual signification that brought them into vital relation with the change in the character of Macbeth. This tragedy illustrates in its close the conventional poetic justice that demands the triumph of the righteous cause and the downfall of the wicked. But there is not lacking that more subtle justice, so impressive in “Lear” because unaccompanied by the temporal reward of the good, which reveals itself in the subduing of character to what it works in. Far more terrible than the defeat and death of Macbeth is the picture of the degradation of his nature, when he appears in the scene before the battle like a beast at bay.

No sooner justice had, with valour arm’d, Compell’d these skipping kerns to trust their heels, But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,’ With furbish’d arms and new supplies of men Began a fresh assault. Dun. Dismay’d not this Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo? Cap. Yes; As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion. If I say sooth, I must report they were As cannons overcharg’d with double cracks; so they Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe. Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds, Or memorize another Golgotha,” I cannot tell. But I am faint, my gashes cry for help. Dun. So well thy words become thee as thy wounds; They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons. [Exit Captain, attended.] Enter Ross and Ancus Who comes here? Mal. The worthy thane of Ross. Len. What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look That seems to speak things strange. Ross. God save the King! Dun. Whence cam’st thou, worthy thane? Ross. From Fife, great king; Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky And fan our people cold.

You seem to understand me, By each at once her choppy finger laying Upon her skinny lips. You should be women, And yet your beards forbid me to interpret That you are so. Macb. Speak, if you can.

[To the Witches.] I’ the name of truth, Are ye fantastical, or that indeed Which outwardly ye show?® My noble partner You greet with present grace and great prediction Of noble having’ and of royal hope, That he seems rapt withal; to me you speak not. If you can look into the seeds of time, And say which grain will grow and which will not, Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear Your favours nor your hate. 1. Witch. Hail! ‘2. Witch. Hail! 3.

Banquo and Macbeth, all hail! Macb, Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more. By Sinel’s death I know I am thane of Glamis; But how of Cawdor? The thane of Cawdor lives, A prosperous gentleman; and to be king Stands not within the prospect of belief No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence You owe this strange intelligence, or why Upon this blasted heath you stop our way With such prophetic greeting. Speak, I charge you. Witches vanish. Ban. The earth hath bubbles, as the water has, And these are of them. Whither are they vanish’d? Macb. Into the air; and what seem’d corporal melted As breath into the wind. Would they had stay’d! Ban.

MACBETH 327 Or have we eaten on the insane root That takes the reason prisoner? Macb, Your children shall be kings. Ban. You shall be King. Macb. And thane of Cawdor too; went it not so? Ban. To the self-same tune and words. Who’s here? Enter Ross and Ancus Ross. The King hath happily receiv’d, Macbeth, The news of thy success; and when he reads Thy personal venture in the rebels’ fight, His wonders and his praises do contend Which should be thine or his. Silenc’d with that, In viewing o’er the rest o’ the self-same day, He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks, Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make, Strange images of death. As thick as hail Came post with post; and every one did bear Thy praises in his kingdom’s great defence; And pour’d them down before him. Ang. We are sent To give thee from our royal master thanks; Only to herald thee into his sight, Not pay thee. Ross. And, for an earnest® of a greater honour, He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor; In which addition,’ hail, most worthy thane! For it is thine. Ban. [ Aside.| What, can the devil speak true? Macb. The thane of Cawdor lives; why do you dress me In borrowed robes? Ang. Who was the thane lives yet; But under heavy judgement bears that life Which he deserves to lose.

[To Ban.] Do you not hope your children shall be kings, When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me Promis’d no less to them? Ban. That trusted home” Might yet enkindle you unto the crown, Besides the thane of Cawdor. But ’tis strange; And oftentimes, to win us to our harm, The instruments of darkness tell us truths, Win us with honest trifles, to betray ’s In deepest consequence. Cousins, a word, I pray you. Macb. [ Aside.] Two truths are told, As happy prologues to the swelling act Of the imperial theme.”—I thank you, gentlemen. [ Aside.] This supernatural soliciting Cannot be ill, cannot be good. If ill, Why hath it given me earnest of success, Commencing in a truth? I’m thane of Cawdor. If good, why do I yield to that suggestion” Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair And make my seated heart knock at my ribs, Against the use“ of nature? Present fears Are less than horrible imaginings. My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,® Shakes so my single state of man” that function” Is smother’d in surmise,'* and nothing is But what is not. Ban. Look, how our partner’s rapt. 11 Thoroughly. 32Drama of kingship. Temptation. Custom. In my imagination. 1 Weak human condition, 17 Power of action. 18 Speculation.

MACBETH 329 Macb. [ Aside.] If chance will have me King, why, chance may crown me, Without my stir. Ban. New honours come upon him, Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould But with the aid of use. Macb. [ Aside.] Come what come may, Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.” Ban. Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure. Macb. Give me your favour;” my dull brain was wrought” With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains Are regist’red where every day I turn The leaf to read them. Let us toward the King. [To Ban.] Think upon what hath chanc’d, and, at more time, The interim having weigh’d it, let us speak Our free” hearts each to other. Ban. Very gladly. Macb. Till then, enough. Come, friends. Exeunt. Scene IV. [Forres. The palace] Flourish. Enter Duncan, Matcotm, Donacsain, Lennox, and Attendants Dun. Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not Those in commission’ yet return’d? Mal. My liege, They are not yet come back. But I have spoke With one that saw him die; who did report That very frankly he confess’d his treasons, Implor’d your Highness’ pardon, and set forth A deep repentance. Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it. He died As one that had been studied in his death To throw away the dearest thing he ow’d, As ’twere a careless trifle. 19 The thing appointed arrives whatever obstacles seem to lie between. 20Pardon. 2!

330 SHAKESPEARE Dun. There’s no art To find the mind’s construction in the face. He was a gentleman on whom I built An absolute trust. Enter Macsetu, Banquo, Ross, and ANcus O worthiest cousin! The sin of my ingratitude even now Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before That swiftest wing of recompense is slow To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserv’d, That the proportion both of thanks and payment Might have been mine! Only I have left to say, More is thy due than more than all can pay. Macb. 'The service and the loyalty I owe, In doing it, pays itself. Your Highness’ part Is to receive our duties; and our duties Are to your throne and state children and servants, - Which do but what they should, by doing everything Safe toward’ your love and honour. Dun. Welcome hither! I have begun to plant thee, and will labour To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo, That hast no less deserv’d, nor must be known No less to have done so, let me infold thee And hold thee to my heart. Ban. There if I grow, The harvest is your own. Dun. My plenteous joys, Wanton’ in fulness, seek to hide themselves In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes, And you whose places are the nearest, know We will establish our estate upon Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must Not unaccompanied invest him only, 2So as to preserve. 3 Unrestrained.

That is a step On which I must fall down, or else o’erleap, For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires; Let not light see my black and deep desires; The eye wink’ at the hand; yet let that be Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see. Exit. Dun. True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant, And in his commendations I am fed; It is a banquet to me. Let’s after him, Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome. It is a peerless kinsman. Flourish.

[Reads.] “They met me in the day of success; and I have learn’d by the perfect’st report, they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I burn’d in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which they vanish’d. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the King, who all-hail’d me ‘Thane of Cawdor;’ by which title, before, these weird sisters’ saluted me, and referr’d me to the coming on of time, with ‘Hail, King that shalt be!’ This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what greatness is promis’d thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.” Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be What thou art promis’d. Yet do I fear thy nature; 4Forerunner. Refuse to see. |! The three Fates.

This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle’ senses. Ban. This guest of summer, The temple-haunting martlet,’ does approve, By his loved masonry, that the heaven’s breath Smells wooingly here; no jutty,* frieze, Buttress, nor coign* of vantage, but this bird Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle. Where they most breed and haunt, I have observ’d The air is delicate. Enter Lavy Macsetu Dun. See, see, our honour’d hostess!

Besides, this Duncan Hath borne his faculties® so meek, hath been So clear’ in his great office, that his virtues Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongu’d, against The deep damnation of his taking-off; And pity, like a naked new-born babe 9 Subject to account. 1 Catch, as in a net. 2 Cessation of the consequence. 3 Risk. 4 Always. 5 Presents. © Official powers. 7 Blameless.

Why have you left the chamber? Macb. Hath he ask’d for me? Lady M. Know you not he has? Macb. We will proceed no further in this business. He hath honour’d me of late; and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people, Which would be worn now in their newest gloss, Not cast aside so soon. Lady M. Was the hope drunk Wherein you dress’d yourself? Hath it slept since? And wakes it now, to look so green and pale At what it did so freely? From this time Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard To be the same in thine own act and valour As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that Which thou esteerm’st the ornament of life, And live a coward in thine own esteem, Letting “I dare not” wait upon “I would,” Like the poor cat i’ the adage?® Macb. Prithee, peace! I dare do all that may become a man; Who dares do more is none. Lady M. What beast was ’t, then, That made you break this enterprise to me?

I have given suck, and know How tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me; I would, while it was smiling in my face, Have pluck’d my nipple from his boneless gums And dash’d the brains out, had I so sworn as you Have done to this. Macb. If we should fail? Lady M. We fail! But screw your courage to the sticking-place, And we'll not fail.

That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold; What hath quench’d them hath given me fire. Hark! Peace! It was the owl that shriek’d, the fatal bellman, Which gives the stern’st good-night. He is about it. The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms Do mock their charge with snores. I have drugg’d their possets,' That death and nature do contend about them, Whether they live or die. Enter MacsETH Macb. Who’s there? What, ho! Lady M. Alack, I am afraid they have awak’d, And ’tis not done. The attempt and not the deed’ Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready; He could not miss ’em. Had he not resembled My father as he slept, I had done ’t—My husband! Macb. 1 have done the deed.

MACBETH 341 Lady M.1 heard the owl scream and the crickets cry. Did not you speak? Macb. When? Lady M. Now. Macb. As I descended? Lady M. Ay. Macb. Hark! Who lies i’ the second chamber? Lady M. Donalbain. Macb. This is a sorry sight. [Looking on his hands.] Lady M. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight. Macb. There’s one did laugh in ’s sleep, and one cried “Murder!” That they did wake each other. I stood and heard them; But they did say their prayers, and address’d them Again to sleep. Lady M. There are two lodg’d together. Macb. One cried, “God bless us!” and “Amen” the other, As they had seen me with these hangman’s hands. Listening their fear, I could not say “Amen,” When they did say, “God bless us!” , Lady M. Consider it not so deeply. Macb. But wherefore could not I pronounce “Amen”? I had most need of blessing, and “Amen” Stuck in my throat. Lady M. These deeds must not be thought After these ways; so, it will make us mad. Macb. Methought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more! Macbeth does murder sleep,’—the innocent sleep, Sleep that knits up the ravell’d sleave® of care, The death of each day’s life, sore labour’s bath, Balm of hurt minds, great nature’s second course, Chief nourisher in life’s feast,— Lady M. What do you mean? Macb. Still it cried, “Sleep no more!” to all the house; “Glamis hath murder’d sleep, and therefore Cawdor Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.” 3 Tangled raw silk.

342 SHAKESPEARE Lady M. Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane, You do unbend your noble strength, to think So brainsickly of things. Go get some water, And wash this filthy witness from your hand. Why did you bring these daggers from the place? They must lie there. Go carry them; and smear The sleepy grooms with blood. Macb. Tll go no more. I am afraid to think what I have done; Look on ’t again I dare not. Lady M. Infirm of purpose! Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead Are but as pictures; ’tis the eye of childhood That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed, T'll gild* the faces of the grooms withal; For it must seem their guilt. Exit. Knocking within. Macb. Whence is that knocking? How is ’t with me, when every noise appalls me? What hands are here? Ha! they pluck out mine eyes. Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather The multitudinous seas incarnadine,’ Making the green one red. Re-enter Lapy Macsetu Lady M. My hands are of your colour; but I shame To wear a heart so white. (Knocking.) I hear a knocking At the south entry. Retire we to our chamber.

(Knocking.) Knock, knock! Who’s there, in the other devil’s name? Faith, here’s an equivocator, that could swear in both the scales against either scale; who committed treason enough for God’s sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven. O, come in, equivocator. (Knocking.) Knock, knock, knock! Who’s there? Faith, here’s an English tailor come hither, for stealing* out of a French hose. Come in, tailor; here you may roast your goose. (Knocking.) Knock, knock; never at quiet! What are you? But this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter it no further.

[Opens the gate.| Enter Macpurr and LENNOX Macd. Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, That you do lie so late? Port. Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things. Macd. What three things does drink especially provoke? Port. Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance; therefore, much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him. Macd. I believe drink gave thee the lie last night. 1Slang. Plenty of turning. 2 Having hoarded grain, 3 Stealing part of the cloth supplied.

Was it not yesterday we spoke together? [1.] Mur. It was, so please your Highness. Macb. Well then, now Have you consider’d of my speeches? Know That it was he in the times past which held you So under fortune, which you thought had been Our innocent self. This I made good to you In our last conference, pass’d in probation® with you, How you were borne in hand,’ how cross’d, the instruments, Who wrought with them, and all things else that might To half a soul and to a notion” craz’d Say, “Thus did Banquo.” 1. Mur. You made it known to us. Macb. 1 did so, and went further, which is now Our point of second meeting. Do you find Your patience so predominant in your nature That you can let this go? Are you so gospell’d" To pray for this good man and for his issue, Whose heavy hand hath bow’d you to the grave And beggar’d yours for ever? 1. Mur. We are men, my liege. Macb, Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men, As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs, Shoughs,” water-rugs,”* and demi-wolves, are clept All by the name of dogs; the valued file* Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle, The housekeeper, the hunter, every one According to the gift which bounteous nature Hath in him clos’d; whereby he does receive Particular addition,” from the bill That writes them all alike; and so of men.

MACBETH 353 Now, if you have a station in the file, Not i’ the worst rank of manhood, say ’t; And I will put that business in your bosoms, Whose execution takes your enemy off, Grapples you to the heart and love of us, Who wear our health but sickly in his life, Which in his death were perfect. 2. Mur. I am one, my liege, Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Hath so incens’d that I am reckless what I do to spite the world. 1. Mur. And I another So weary with disasters, tugg’d with fortune, That I would set my life on any chance, To mend it, or be rid on ’t. Macb. Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy. [Both] Mur. True, my lord. Macb. So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,”* That every minute of his being thrusts Against my near’st of life,” and though I could With barefac’d power sweep him from my sight And bid my will avouch it,” yet I must not, For certain friends that are both his and mine, Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall Who I myself struck down; and thence it is, That I to your assistance do make love, Masking the business from the common eye For sundry weighty reasons. 2. Mur. We shall, my lord, Perform what you command us. 1. Mur. Though our lives— Macb. Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most I will advise’ you where to plant yourselves; Acquaint you with the perfect spy o’ the time, The moment on ’t; for ’t must be done to-night, 16 At such dangerously close quarters. !7My most vital parts. 18 Take the responsibility. | !9 Instruct.

Resolve yourselves apart; T’ll come to you anon. [Both] Mur. Weare resolv’d, my lord. Macb. Tl call upon you straight; abide within. [Exeunt Murderers.]} It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul’s flight, If it find heaven, must find it out to-night. Exit. Scene II. [The palace] Enter Lavy Macsetu and a Servant Lady M. 1s Banquo gone from court? Serv. Ay, madam, but returns again to-night. Lady M. Say to the King, I would attend his leisure For a few words. Serv. Madam, I will. Exit. Lady M. Nought’s had, all’s spent, Where our desire is got without content. ’Tis safer to be that which we destroy Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy. Enter MacsetTu How now, my lord! why do you keep alone, Of sorriest fancies your companions making, Using those thoughts which should indeed have died With them they think on? Things without all remedy Should be without regard; what’s done is done. Macb.

MACBETH 355 Remains in danger of her former tooth. But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer, Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep In the affliction of these terrible dreams That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace, Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave; After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well. Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison, Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing, Can touch him further. Lady M. Come on, Gentle my lord, sleek o’er your rugged looks; Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night. Macb. So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you. Let your remembrance apply to Banquo; Present him eminence,’ both with eye and tongue. Unsafe the while, that we Must lave our honours in these flattering streams, And make our faces vizards to our hearts, Disguising what they are. Lady M. You must leave this. Macb. O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife! Thou know’st that Banquo and his Fleance lives. Lady M. But in them nature’s copy’s’ not eterne. Macb. There’s comfort yet; they are assailable. Then be thou jocund; ere the bat hath flown His cloister’d flight, ere to black Hecate’s summons The shard-borne* beetle with his drowsy hums Hath rung night’s yawning peal, there shall be done A deed of dreadful note. Lady M. What’s to be done? Macb. Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, Till thou applaud the deed.

Light thickens, and the crow Makes wing to the rooky wood; Good things of day begin to droop and drowse, Whiles night’s black agents to their preys do rouse. Thou marvell’st at my words, but hold thee still; Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill. So, prithee, go with me. Exeunt. Scene III. [A park near the palace] Enter three Murderers 1. Mur. But who did bid thee join with us? 3. Mur. Macbeth. 2. Mur. He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers’ Our offices and what we have to do To the direction just. 1. Mur. Then stand with us; The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day. Now spurs the lated traveller apace To gain the timely inn; and near approaches The subject of our watch. 3. Mur. Hark! I hear horses. Ban. (Within.) Give us a light there, ho! 2. Mur. Then ’tis he; the rest That are within the note of expectation’ Already are i’ the court. 1. Mur. His horses go about. 3. Mur.

You know your own degrees; sit down. At first And last, the hearty welcome. Lords. Thanks to your Majesty. Macb. Ourself will mingle with society And play the humble host. Our hostess keeps her state,’ but in best time We will require her welcome. Lady M. Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends, For my heart speaks they are welcome. First Murderer [appears at the door] Macb. See, they encounter thee with their hearts’ thanks. Both sides are even; here I'll sit i’ the midst. Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure The table round. [ Approaching the door.| —There’s blood upon thy face. Mur. "Tis Banquo’s then. Macb., "Tis better thee without than he within. Is he dispatch’d? 1 Throne.

Mur. Most royal sir, Fleance is scap’d. Macb. Then comes my fit again. I had else been perfect, Whole as the marble, founded as the rock, As broad and general as the casing air; But now I am cabin’d, cribb’d, confin’d, bound in To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo’s safe? Mur. Ay, my good lord; safe in a ditch he bides, With twenty trenched gashes on his head, The least a death to nature. Macb. Thanks for that; There the grown serpent lies. The worm’ that’s fled Hath nature that in time will venom breed, No teeth for the present. Get thee gone; to-morrow We'll hear ourselves again.“ Exit Murderer. Lady M. My royal lord, You do not give the cheer. The feast is sold That is not often vouch’d, while ’tis a-making, ’Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home; From thence, the sauce to meat is ceremony; Meeting were bare without it. Enter the Ghost of Banquo, and sits in Macpetu’s place Macb. Sweet remembrancer! Now, good digestion wait on appetite, And health on both! Len. May ’t please your Highness sit. Macb.

Gentlemen, rise: his Highness is not well. Lady M. Sit, worthy friends; my lord is often thus, And hath been from his youth. Pray you, keep seat; The fit is momentary; upon a thought He will again be well. If much you note him, You shall offend him and extend his passion.’ Feed, and regard him not. [Aside to Macsetu.| Are you a man? Macb. Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that Which might appall the devil. Lady M. [ Aside to Macsetu.] O proper® stuff! This is the very painting of your fear; This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said, Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws’ and starts, Impostors to* true fear, would well become A woman’s story at a winter’s fire, Authoriz’d® by her grandam. Shame itself! Why do you make such faces? When all’s done, You look but on a stool. Macb. Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo! how say you? Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.

Blood hath been shed ere now, i’ the olden time, Ere humane statute purg’d the gentle weal;" Ay, and since too, murders have been perform’d Too terrible for the ear. The time has been, That, when the brains were out, the man would die, And there an end; but now they rise again, With twenty mortal murders” on their crowns, And push us from our stools. This is more strange Than such a murder is. Lady M. My worthy lord, Your noble friends do lack you. Macb. I do forget. Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends; I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing To those that know me. Come, love and health to all; Then I’ll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full. * Re-enter Ghost I drink to the general joy o’ the whole table, And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss; Would he were here! to all and him we thirst, And all to all. Lords. Our duties, and the pledge. Macb, Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee! Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold; Thou hast no speculation” in those eyes Which thou dost glare with! Lady M. Think of this, good peers, But as a thing of custom; ’tis no other, Only it spoils the pleasure of the time. Macb. What man dare, I dare. Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear, The arm’d rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger; 11 Made the state gentle by purging it. 12Deadly wounds. 8 Sight.

Hence, horrible shadow! Unreal mockery, hence! [Ghost vanishes.] Why, so; being gone, I am a man again. Pray you, sit still. Lady M. You have displac’d the mirth, broke the good meeting, With most admir’d® disorder. Macb. Can such things be, And overcome” us like a summer’s cloud, Without our special wonder? You make me strange” Even to the disposition that I owe, When now I think you can behold such sights, And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks, When mine is blanch’d with fear. Ross. What sights, my lord? Lady M.1 pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse; Question enrages him. At once, good-night. Stand not upon the order of your going, But go at once. Len. Good-night; and better health Attend his Majesty! Lady M. A kind good-night to all! Exeunt Lords. Macb, It will have blood, they say; blood will have blood. Stones have been known to move and trees to speak; Augures™ and understood” relations have By maggot-pies and choughs” and rooks brought forth The secret’st man of blood. What is the night? Lady M. Almost at odds with morning, which is which. Macb. How say’st thou, that Macduff denies his person At our great bidding? Lady M. Did you send to him, sir? Macb. I hear it by the way; but I will send.

How did you dare To trade and traffic with Macbeth In riddles and affairs of death; And I, the mistress of your charms, The close’ contriver of all harms, Was never call’d to bear my part, Or show the glory of our art? And, which is worse, all you have done Hath been but for a wayward son, Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do, Loves for his own ends, not for you.

He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear His hopes ’bove wisdom, grace, and fear; And, you all know, security* Is mortals’ chiefest enemy. Music, and a song Hark!

Ay, and wisely too; For ’twould have anger’d any heart alive To hear the men deny ’t. So that, I say, He has borne all things well; and I do think That had he Duncan’s sons under his key— As, an ’t please Heaven, he shall not—they should find What ’twere to kill a father; so should Fleance. But, peace! for from broad’ words, and ’cause he fail’d His presence at the tyrant’s feast, I hear Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell Where he bestows himself? Lord. The son of Duncan, From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth, Lives in the English court, and is receiv’d Of the most pious Edward with such grace That the malevolence of Fortune nothing Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward; That, by the help of these—with Him above To ratify the work—we may again Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights, Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives, Do faithful homage and receive free honours; All which we pine for now: and this report Hath so exasperate their king that he Prepares for some attempt of war. Len. Sent he to Macduff? Lord. He did; and with‘ an absolute “Sir, not I,” The cloudy messenger turns me his back, And hums, as who should say, “You'll rue the time That clogs me with this answer.” Len.

372 SHAKESPEARE With wit enough for thee. Son. Was my father a traitor, mother? L. Macd. Ay, that he was. Son. What is a traitor? L. Macd. Why, one that swears and lies. Son. And be all traitors that do so? L. Macd. Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hang’d. Son. And must they all be hang’d that swear and lie? L. Macd. Every one. Son. Who must hang them? L. Macd. Why, the honest men. Son. Then the liars and swearers are fools; for there are liars and swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them. L. Macd. Now, God help thee, poor monkey! But how wilt thou do for a father? Son. If he were dead, you’d weep for him; if you would not, it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father. L. Macd. Poor prattler, how thou talk’st! Enter a Messenger Mess. Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known, Though in your state of honour I am perfect.’ I doubt some danger does approach you nearly. If you will take a homely man’s advice, Be not found here; hence, with your little ones. To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage; To do worse to you were fell cruelty, Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you! I dare abide no longer. Exit. L. Macd. Whither should I fly? I have done no harm. But I remember now I am in this earthly world, where to do harm Is often laudable, to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly. Why then, alas, Do I put up that womanly defence, To say I have done no harm? 31 am perfectly familiar with your rank.

MACBETH 373 Enter Murderers What are these faces? [1.] Mur. Where is your husband? L. Macd. I hope, in no place so unsanctified Where such as thou may’st find him. [1.] Mur. He’s a traitor. Son. Thou liest, thou shag-ear’d villain! [1.] Mur. What, you egg! [Stabbing him.] Young fry of treachery! Son, He has kill’d me, mother: Run away, I pray you! [ Dies. ] Exit [Lapy Macpurr] crying “Murder!” [Exeunt Murderers, following her.] Scene III. [England. Before the King’s palace] Enter Matcotm and Macpurr Mal. Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there Weep our sad bosoms empty. Macd. Let us rather Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men Bestride our down-fallen birthdom.’ Each new morn New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland, and yell’d out Like syllable of dolour. Mal. What I believe I'll wail, What know believe, and what I can redress, As I shall find the time to friend, I will. What you have spoke, it may be so perchance. This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues, Was once thought honest; you have lov’d him well. He hath not touch’d you yet. Iam young; but something You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom 1 Native country.

374 SHAKESPEARE To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb To appease an angry god. Macd. 1 am not treacherous. Mal. But Macbeth is. A good and virtuous nature may recoil In an imperial charge.’ But I shall crave your pardon; That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose. Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell. Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace, Yet grace must still look so. Macd. I have lost my hopes. Mal. Perchance even there where I did find my doubts, Why in that rawness* left you wife and child, Those precious motives, those strong knots of love, Without leave-taking? I pray you, Let not my jealousies be your dishonours, But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just, Whatever I shall think. Macd. Bleed, bleed, poor country! Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure, For goodness dare not check thee; wear thou thy wrongs; The title is affeer’d!* Fare thee well, lord: I would not be the villain that thou think’st For the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp, And the rich East to boot. Mal. Be not offended; I speak not as in absolute fear of you. I think our country sinks beneath the yoke; It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds. I think withal There would be hands uplifted in my right; And here from gracious England have I offer Of goodly thousands. But, for all this, When I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head, Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country Shall have more vices than it had before, 2 Under a king’s orders. 3 Without preparation. 4 Sanctioned.

MACBETH More suffer and more sundry ways than ever, By him that shall succeed. Macd. What should he be? Mal. It is myself 1 mean; in whom I know All the particulars of vice so grafted That, when they shall be open’d, black Macbeth Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state Esteem him as a lamb, being compar’d With my confineless’ harms. Maced. Not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn’d In evils to top Macbeth. Mal. I grant him bloody, Luxurious,® avaricious, false, deceitful, Sudden,’ malicious, smacking of every sin That has a name; but there’s no bottom, none, In my voluptuousness. Your wives, your daughters, Your matrons, and your maids, could not fill up The cistern of my lust, and my desire ; All continent® impediments would o’erbear That did oppose my will. Better Macbeth Than such an one to reign. Macd. Boundless intemperance In nature is a tyranny; it hath been The untimely emptying of the happy throne And fall of many kings. But fear not yet To take upon you what is yours. You may Convey’ your pleasures in a spacious plenty, And yet seem cold; the time” you may so hoodwink. We have willing dames enough; there cannot be That vulture in you, to devour so many As will to greatness dedicate themselves, Finding it so inclin’d. Mal. With this there grows In my most ill-compos’d affection” such SBoundless. §Lustful. 7Hasty. ®Restraining. Carry on. 11 Badly constituted disposition. 375 10 Society.

Macd. This avarice Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root Than summer-seeming™ lust, and it hath been The sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear; Scotland hath foisons” to fill up your will, Of your mere own. All these are portable,”* With other graces weigh’d."® Mal. But I have none. The king-becoming graces, As justice, verity, temperance, stableness, Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness, Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude, I have no relish” of them, but abound In the division of each several crime, Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell, Uproar the universal peace, confound All unity on earth. Macd. O Scotland, Scotland! Mal. If such an one be fit to govern, speak. I am as I have spoken. Macd. Fit to govern! No, not to live. O nation miserable, With an untitled’ tyrant bloody-sceptred, When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again, Since that the truest issue of thy throne By his own interdiction stands accurs’d, And does blaspheme” his breed? Thy royal father Was a most sainted king; the queen that bore thee, 12 Insatiable. 13 Belonging to the prime of life. 14 Abundance. 16 Balanced. 17 Flavor. 38 Without just claim. 9 Slander. 4 Tolerable.

MACBETH Oftener upon her knees than on her feet, Died every day she liv’d. Fare thee well! These evils thou repeat’st upon thyself Hath banish’d me from Scotland. O my breast, Thy hope ends here! Mal. Macduff, this noble passion, Child of integrity, hath from my soul Wip’d the black scruples, reconcil’d my thoughts To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth By many of these trains” hath sought to win me Into his power, and modest” wisdom plucks me From over-credulous haste. But God above Deal between thee and me! for even now I put myself to thy direction, and Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure The taints and blames I laid upon myself, For strangers to my nature. I am yet Unknown to woman, never was forsworn, Scarcely have coveted what was mine own, At no time broke my faith, would not betray The devil to his fellow, and delight No less in truth than life; my first false speaking Was this upon myself. What I am truly, Is thine and my poor country’s to command; Whither indeed, before thy here-approach, Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men, Already at a point,” was setting forth. Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent? Macd. Such welcome and unwelcome things at once *Tis hard to reconcile. Enter a Doctor Mal.

Mal. Tis call’d the evil: A most miraculous work in this good king; Which often, since my here-remain in England, I have seen him do. How he solicits Heaven, Himself best knows; but strangely-visited” people, All swollen and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye, The mere despair of surgery, he cures, Hanging a golden stamp about their necks, Put on with holy prayers; and ’tis spoken, To the succeeding royalty he leaves The healing benediction. With this strange virtue, He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy, And sundry blessings hang about his throne, That speak him full of grace. Enter Ross Macd. See, who comes here? Mal. My countryman; but yet I know him not. Macd. My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither. Mal. I know him now. Good God, betimes” remove The means that makes us strangers! Ross. Sir, amen. Macd. Stands Scotland where it did? Ross. Alas, poor country! Almost afraid to know itself.

What's the newest grief? Ross. That of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker; Each minute teems™ a new one. Macd. How does my wife? Ross. Why, well. Macd. And all my children? Ross. Well too. Macd. The tyrant has not batter’d at their peace? Ross. No; they were well at peace when I did leave ’em. Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech; how goes ’t? Ross. When I came hither to transport the tidings, Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour Of many worthy fellows that were out;” Which was to my belief witness’d the rather, For that I saw the tyrant’s power a-foot. — Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland Would create soldiers, make our women fight, To doff their dire distresses. Mal. Be ’t their comfort We're coming thither. Gracious England hath Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men; An older and a better soldier none That Christendom gives out. Ross. Would I could answer This comfort with the like! But I have words That would be howl’d out in the desert air, Where hearing should not latch* them. Maced. What concern they? The general cause?

Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever, Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound That ever yet they heard. Macd. Hum! I guess at it. Ross. Your castle is surpris’d; your wife and babes Savagely slaughter’d. To relate the manner, Were, on the quarry® of these murder’d deer, To add the death of you. Mal. Merciful heaven! What, man! ne’er pull your hat upon your brows; Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak Whispers the o’er-fraught™ heart and bids it break. Macd. My children too? Ross. Wife, children, servants, all That could be found. Macd. And I must be from thence! My wife kill’d too? Ross. I have said. Mal. Be comforted. Let’s make us medicines of our great revenge, To cure this deadly grief. Macd. He has no children.—All my pretty ones? Did you say all? O hell-kite! All? What, all my pretty chickens and their dam At one fell swoop? Mal. Dispute” it like a man. Macd. I shall do so; But I must also feel it as a man. I cannot but remember such things were, That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on, And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff, 35 Dead bodies. 36 Over-burdened. 37 Strive against.

MACBETH 381 They were all struck for thee! Naught® that I am, Not for their own demerits, but for mine, Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now! Mal. Be this the whetstone of your sword; let grief Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it. Macd. O,1 could play the woman with mine eyes And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens, Cut short all intermission. Front to front Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself; Within my sword’s length set him; if he scape, Heaven forgive him too! Mal. This tune goes manly. Come, go we to the King; our power is ready; Our lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above Put on“ their instruments.

I have two nights watch’d with you, but can perceive no truth in your report. When was it she last walk’d? Gent. Since his Majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon ’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep. Doct. A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching!’ In this slumb’ry agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say? Gent. That, sir, which I will not report after her. Doct. You may to me: and ’tis most meet you should. Gent.

Why, it stood by her. She has light by her continually; ‘tis her command. Doct. You see, her eyes are open. Gent. Ay, but their sense are shut. Doct. What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands. Gent. It is an accustom’d action with her, to seem thus washing her hands. I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour. Lady M. Yet here’s a spot. Doct. Hark! she speaks. I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly. Lady M. Out, damned spot! out, I say!—One: two: why, then tis time to do ’t—Hell is murky!—Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account?—Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him? Doct. Do you mark that? Lady M. The thane of Fife had a wife; where is she now?—What, will these hands ne’er be clean?—No more o’ that, my lord, no more o’ that; you mar all with this starting. Doct. Go to, go to; you have known what you should not. Gent. She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that; Heaven knows what she has known. Lady M. Here’s the smell of the blood still; all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh! Doct. What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charg’d” Gent.

Come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What’s done cannot be undone.—To bed, to bed, to bed! Exit. Doct. Will she go now to bed? Gent. Directly. Doct. Foul whisp’rings are abroad; unnatural deeds Do breed unnatural troubles; infected minds To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets. More needs she the divine than the physician.

Now does he feel His secret murders sticking on his hands; Now minutely” revolts upbraid his faith-breach; Those he commands move only in command, Nothing in love. Now does he feel his title Hang loose about him, like a giant’s robe Upon a dwarfish thief. Ment. Who then shall blame His pester’d” senses to recoil and start, When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there? Caith. Well, march we on To give obedience where ’tis truly ow’d.

It is the cry of women, my good lord. [Exit.] Macb, I have almost forgot the taste of fears.

Within this three mile may you see it coming; I say, a moving grove. Macb. If thou speak’st false, Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive, Till famine cling* thee; if thy speech be sooth, I care not if thou dost for me as much.

And be these juggling fiends no more believ’d That palter with us in a double sense, That keep the word of promise to our ear, And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee. Macd. Then yield thee, coward, And live to be the show and gaze o’ the time. We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are, Painted upon a pole,’ and underwrit, “Here may you see the tyrant.” Macb. I will not yield, To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet And to be baited with the rabble’s curse. Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane, And thou oppos’d, being of no woman born, Yet I will try the last. Before my body I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff, And damn’d be him that first cries, “Hold, enough!” Exeunt, fighting. Alarums. Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, Ma.coum, old Srward, Ross, the other Thanes, and Soldiers Mal. 1 would the friends we miss were safe arriv’d. Siw. Some must go off;* and yet, by these I see, 2 Not to be injured by cutting. 3A cloth hanging from a pole. 4 Die.

MACBETH 393 So great a day as this is cheaply bought. Mal. Macduff is missing, and your noble son. Ross. Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier’s debt. He only liv’d but till he was a man; The which no sooner had his prowess confirm’d In the unshrinking station where he fought, But like a man he died. Siw. Then he is dead? Ross. Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow Must not be measur’d by his worth, for then It hath no end. Siw. Had he his hurts before? Ross. Ay, on the front. Siw. Why then, God’s soldier be he! Had I as many sons as I have hairs, I would not wish them to a fairer death. And so, his knell is knoll’d. Mal. He’s worth more sorrow, And that I’ll spend for him. , Siw, He’s worth no more. They say he parted well, and paid his score; And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort. Re-enter Macpurr, with Macsrru’s head Macd. Hail, king! for so thou art. Behold, where stands The usurper’s cursed head. The time is free. I see thee compass’d with thy kingdom’s pearl, That speak my salutation in their minds; Whose voices I desire aloud with mine: Hail, King of Scotland! All. Hail, King of Scotland! Flourish. Mal. We shall not spend a large expense of time Before we reckon with your several loves, And make us even with you.

394 SHAKESPEARE As calling home our exil’d friends abroad That fled the snares of watchful tyranny; Producing forth the cruel ministers Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen, Who, as ’tis thought, by self and violent hands Took off her life; this, and what needful else That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace, We will perform in measure, time, and place. So, thanks to all at once and to each one, Whom we invite to see us crown’d at Scone. Flourish . Exeunt.

THE TEMPEST BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE

INTRODUCTORY NOTE Ir is entirely probable that the date of “The Tempest” is 1611, and that this was the last play completed by Shakespeare before he retired from active connection with the theater to spend the remainder of his life in leisure in his native town of Stratford-on-Avon. The main thread of the plot of the drama seems to have been some folk-tale of a magician and his daughter, which, in the precise form in which Shakespeare knew it, has not been recovered. The storm and the island were, it is believed, suggested by the wreck on the Bermudas in 1609 of one of the English expeditions to Virginia. Traces are found, too, of the author’s reading in contemporary books of travel. But the plot itself is of less importance than usual. Supernatural elements are introduced with great freedom, and the dramatist’s interest was clearly not in the reproduction of lifelike events. The presentation of character and the attractive picturing of the beauty of magnanimity and forgiveness are the things which, along with its delightful poetry, make the charm of this play. It is not to be wondered at that readers have frequently been led to find in the figure of the great magician, laying aside his robes and wonder-working rod in a spirit of love and peace toward all men, a symbol of the dramatist himself at the close of his great career; and it is surely legitimate to play with this idea without assuming that Shakespeare consciously embodied it. One can hardly conceive a more fitting epilogue to the volume which is the crown of the world’s dramatic literature than the romance of “The Tempest.”

Where is the master, boatswain? Boats. Do you not hear him? You mar our labour. Keep your cabins; you do assist the storm. Gon. Nay, good, be patient. Boats. When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers for the name of king? To cabin! silence! trouble us not. Gon. Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard. Boats. None that I more love than myself. You are a counsellor; if you can command these elements to silence, and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope more; use your authority. If you cannot, give thanks you have liv’d so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap— Cheerly, good hearts!—Out of our way, I say. Exit. Gon. I have great comfort from this fellow. Methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging; make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth little advantage. If he be not born to be hang’d, our case is miserable. Exeunt.

THE TEMPEST 399 Ant. Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker! We are less afraid to be drown’d than thou art. Gon. I'll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nut-shell and as leaky as an unstanched wench. Boats. Lay her a-hold,’ a-hold! Set her two courses* off to sea again! Lay her off. Enter Mariners wet Mariners. All lost! To prayers, to prayers! All lost! Boats. What, must our mouths be cold? Gon. The King and Prince at prayers!

Let’s take leave of him. Exit. Gon. Now would I givé a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, anything.

If by your art, my dearest father, you have Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them. The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, But that the sea, mounting to the welkin’s cheek, Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered 3 Bring her close to the wind. 4 The mainsail and foresail. 5 Absolutely.

400 SHAKESPEARE With those that I saw suffer! A brave vessel, Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her, Dash’d all to pieces! O, the cry did knock Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish’d. Had I been any god of power, I would Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere It should the good ship so have swallow’d and The fraughting" souls within her. Pros. Be collected; No more amazement. Tell your piteous heart There’s no harm done. Mir. O, woe the day! Pros. No harm. I have done nothing but in care of thee, Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing Of whence I am, nor that J am more better Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell, And thy no greater father. Mir. More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts. Pros. *Tis time I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand, And pluck my magic garment from me. So, [Lays down his mantle.] Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort. The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch’d The very virtue of compassion in thee, I have with such provision in mine art So safely ordered that there is no soul— No, not so much perdition as an hair Betid to any creature in the vessel Which thou heard’st cry, which thou saw’st sink. Sit down; For thou must now know farther. Mir. You have often Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp’d 1 Composing the freight.

THE TEMPEST 401 And left me to a bootless inquisition, Concluding, “Stay, not yet.” Pros. The hour’s now come; The very minute bids thee ope thine ear. Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell? I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not Out three years old. Mir. Certainly, sir, I can. Pros. By what? By any other house or person? Of anything the image tell me, that Hath kept with thy remembrance. Mir. Tis far off And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants. Had I not Four or five women once that tended me? Pros. Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else In the dark backward and abysm’ of time? If thou rememb’rest aught ere thou cam’st here, How thou cam’st here thou may’st. Mir. But that I do not. Pros. Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since, Thy father was the Duke of Milan and A prince of power. Mir. Sir, are not you my father? Pros. Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father Was Duke of Milan, and his only heir And princess no worse issued. Mir. O the heavens! What foul play had we, that we came from thence? Or blessed was ’t we did? Pros. Both, both, my girl. By foul play, as thou say’st, were we heav’d thence, But blessedly holp hither. 2 Depth.

402 SHAKESPEARE Mir. O, my heart bleeds To think o’ the teen® that I have turn’d you to, Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther. Pros. My brother and thy uncle, call’d Antonio— I pray thee, mark me—that a brother should Be so perfidious!—he whom next thyself Of all the world I lov’d, and to him put The manage’ of my state; as at that time Through all the signories? it was the first, And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed In dignity, and for the liberal arts Without a parallel; those being all my study, The government I cast upon my brother And to my state grew stranger, being transported And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle— Dost thou attend me? Mir. Sir, most heedfully. Pros. Being once perfected how to grant suits, How to deny them, who to advance and who To trash for overtopping,’ new created The creatures that were mine, I say, or chang’d ’em, Or else new form’d ’em; having both the key Of officer and office, set all hearts i’ the state To what tune pleas’d his ear; that now he was The ivy which had hid my princely trunk, And suck’d my verdure out on ’t. Thou attend’st not. Mir. O, good sir, I do. Pros, I pray thee, mark me. I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated To closeness’ and the bettering of my mind With that which, but by being so retir’d, O’er-priz’d all popular rate,*® in my false brother Awak’d an evil nature; and my trust, Like a good parent, did beget of him A falsehood, in its contrary as great 3 Trouble. 4Management. ‘Lordships. To check for excessive ambition. 7Seclusion. 8 Was more valuable than popularity.

THE TEMPEST 403 As my trust was; which had indeed no limit, A confidence sans’ bound. He being thus lorded, Not only with what my revenue yielded, But what my power might else exact,—like one Who having into truth, by telling of it, Made such a sinner of his memory To credit his own lie,—he did believe He was indeed the Duke. Out o’ the substitution,’ And executing the outward face of royalty, With all prerogative, hence his ambition growing— Dost thou hear? Mir. Your tale, sir, would cure deafness. Pros. To have no screen between this part he play’d And him he play’d it for, he needs will be Absolute Milan. Me, poor man!—my library Was dukedom large enough—of temporal royalties He thinks me now incapable; confederates— So dry" he was for sway—wi’ the King of Naples To give him annual tribute, do him homage, Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend The dukedom yet unbow’d—alas, poor Milan!— To most ignoble stooping. Mir. O the heavens! Pros. Mark his condition and the event, then tell me If this might be a brother. Mir. I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother. Good wombs have borne bad sons. Pros. Now the condition. This King of Naples, being an enemy To me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit; Which was, that he, in lieu o’ the premises” Of homage and I know not how much tribute, Should presently extirpate me and mine Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan 8 Without. 10 From being deputy. 11 Thirsty. 32In return for the conditions.

404 SHAKESPEARE With all the honours on my brother; whereon, A treacherous army levied, one midnight Fated to the purpose did Antonio open The gates of Milan; and, i’ the dead of darkness, The ministers for the purpose hurried thence Me and thy crying self. Mir. Alack, for pity! I, not rememb’ring how I cried out then, Will cry it o’er again. It is a hint’ That wrings mine eyes to ’t. Pros. Hear a little further, And then I'll bring thee to the present business Which now’s upon ’s, without the which this story Were most impertinent.” Mir. Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us? Pros. Well demanded, wench; My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not (So dear the love my people bore me) set A mark so bloody on the business; but With colours fairer painted their foul ends. In few, they hurried us aboard a bark, Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared A rotten carcass of a butt,” not rigg’d, Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats Instinctively have quit it. There they hoist us, To cry to the sea that roar’d to us, to sigh To the winds whose pity, sighing back again, Did us but loving wrong. Mir. Alack, what trouble Was I then to you! Pros. O, a cherubin Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile, Infused with a fortitude from heaven, When I have deck’d the sea with drops full salt, Under my burden groan’d; which rais’d in me 13 Occasion, suggestion. 14 Not to the purpose. Old tub, hulk.

THE TEMPEST 405 An undergoing” stomach, to bear up Against what should ensue. Mir, How came we ashore? Pros. By Providence divine. Some food we had and some fresh water that A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo, Out of his charity, who being then appointed Master of this design, did give us, with Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries, Which since have steaded much;” so, of his gentleness, Knowing I lov’d my books, he furnish’d me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom. Mir. Would I might But ever see that man! Pros. Now I arise. [Puts on his robe.] Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow. Here in this island we arriv’d; and here Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit Than other princess can that have more time For vainer hours, and tutors not so careful. Mir. Heavens thank you for ’t! And now, I pray you, sir, For still ’tis beating in my mind, your reason For raising this sea-storm? Pros. Know thus far forth. By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune, Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies Brought to this shore; and by my prescience I find my zenith® doth depend upon A most auspicious star, whose influence If now I court not but omit, my fortunes Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions. Thou art inclin’d to sleep; ’tis a good dulness, And give it way. I know thou canst not choose. [Mrranpa sleeps.] Come away, servant, come; I am ready now. Approach, my Ariel; come. Enduring. 17 Stood in good stead. 18 The highest point in my fortunes.

406 SHAKESPEARE Enter ARtEL Ari, All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come To answer thy best pleasure, be ’t to fly, To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride On the curl’d clouds. To thy strong bidding task Ariel and all his quality.” Pros. Hast thou, spirit, Perform’d to point” the tempest that I bade thee? Ari, 'To every article. I boarded the king’s ship; now on the beak, Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin, I flam’d amazement. Sometime I’d divide, And burn in many places. On the topmast, The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly, Then meet and join. Jove’s lightnings, the precursors O’ the dreadful thunder-laps, more momentary And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune Seem to besiege, and make his bold waves tremble, Yea, his dread trident shake. Pros. My brave spirit! Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil” Would not infect his reason? Ari. Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad, and play’d Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners Plung’d in the foaming brine and quit the vessel, Then all afire with me. The King’s son, Ferdinand, With hair up-staring,—then like reeds, not hair,— Was the first man that leap’d; cried, “Hell is empty, And all the devils are here.” Pros. Why, that’s my spirit! But was not this nigh shore? Ari. Close by, my master. 19Power, 2 Exactly. 21 Turmoil.

THE TEMPEST Pros. But are they, Ariel, safe? Art. Not a hair perish’d; On their sustaining garments not a blemish, But fresher than before; and, as thou bad’st me, In troops I have dispers’d them ’bout the isle. The King’s son have I landed by himself, Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting, His arms in this sad knot. Pros. Of the King’s ship The mariners say how thou hast dispos’d, And all the rest o’ the fleet. Ari. Safely in harbour Is the King’s ship; in the deep nook, where once Thou call’dst me up at midnight to fetch dew From the still-vex’d Bermoothes, there she’s hid; The mariners all under hatches stow’d, Who, with a charm join’d to their suff’red labour, I have left asleep; and for the rest o’ the fleet, Which I dispers’d, they all have met again, And are upon the Mediterranean float” Bound sadly home for Naples, Supposing that they saw the King’s ship wreck’d And his great person perish. Pros. Ariel, thy charge Exactly is perform’d; but there’s more work. What is the time o’ the day? Art. Past the mid season. Pros. At least two glasses. The time ’twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously. Art. Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains, Let me remember thee what thou hast promis’d, Which is not yet perform’d me. Pros. How now? moody? What is ’t thou canst demand? Ari. My liberty. 22 Sea.

408 SHAKESPEARE Pros. Before the time be out? No more! Ari. I prithee, Remember I have done thee worthy service, Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, serv’d Without or grudge or grumblings. Thou did promise To bate® me a full year. Pros. Dost thou forget From what a torment I did free thee? Art. No. Pros. Thou dost, and think’st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep, To run upon the sharp wind of the north, To do me business in the veins o’ the earth When it is bak’d with frost. Art. I do not, sir. Pros. Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop? Hast thou forgot her? Ari. No, sir. Pros. Thou hast. Where was she born? Speak; tell me. Ari. Sir, in Argier.™ Pros. O, was she so? I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been, Which thou forget’st. This damn’d witch Sycorax, For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing, from Argier, Thou know’st, was banish’d; for one thing she did They would not take her life. Is not this true? Ari. Ay, sir. Pros. This blue-ey’d hag was hither brought with child, And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave, As thou report’st thyself, was then her servant; And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate To act her earthy and abhorr’d commands, Refusing her grand hests,” she did confine thee, By help of her more potent ministers 23 Reduce my service. Algiers. > Commands.

THE TEMPEST 409 And in her most unmitigable rage, Into a cloven pine; within which rift Imprison’d thou didst painfully remain A dozen years; within which space she died And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island— Save for the son that she did litter here, A freckl’d whelp, hag-born,—not honour’d with A human shape. Ari. Yes, Caliban her son. Pros. Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know’st What torment I did find thee in; thy groans Did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts Of ever angry bears. It was a torment To lay upon the damn’d, which Sycorax Could not again undo. It was mine art, When I arriv’d and heard thee, that made gape The pine, and let thee out. Ari, I thank thee, master. Pros. If thou more murmur’st, I will rend an oak And peg thee in his knotty entrails till Thou hast howl’d away twelve winters. Ari, Pardon, master; I will be correspondent” to command And do my spiriting gently. Pros. Do so, and after two days I will discharge thee. Ari. That’s my noble master! What shall I do? say what. What shall I do? Pros. Go make thyself like a nymph o’ the sea; be subject To no sight but thine and mine, invisible To every eyeball else. Go take this shape And hither come in ’t. Go, hence with diligence! Exit ARIEL, Awake, dear heart, awake! Thou hast slept well; Awake! 26 Responsive.

Tis a villain, sir, I do not love to look on. Pros, But, as ’tis, We cannot miss him. He does make our fire, Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices. That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban! Thou earth, thou! speak. Cal. (Within.) There’s wood enough within. Pros. Come forth, I say! there’s other business for thee. Come, thou tortoise! when?

THE TEMPEST 417 ACT II Scene I. [Another part of the island] Enter Atonso, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GoNzALO, ADRIAN, Francisco, and others Gon. Beseech you sir, be merry; you have. cause, So have we all, of joy; for our escape Is much beyond our loss. Our hint' of woe Is common; every day some sailor’s wife, The masters of some merchant, and the merchant Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle, I mean our preservation, few in millions Can speak like us. Then wisely, good sir, weigh Our sorrow with our comfort. Alon. Prithee, peace. Seb. He receives comfort like cold porridge. Ant. The visitor will not give him o’er so. Seb. Look, he’s winding up the watch of his wit; by and by it will strike. Gon. Sir,— Seb. One. Tell? Gon, When every grief is entertain’d that’s offer’d, Comes to the entertainer— Seb. A dollar. Gon. Dolour comes to him, indeed; you have spoken truer than you purpos’d. Seb. You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should. Gon, Therefore, my lord,— Ant. Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue! Alon. J prithee, spare. Gon. Well, I have done. But yet,— Seb. He will be talking. Ant. Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first begins to crow? Seb. The old cock. 1 Occasion. 2 Count.

418 SHAKESPEARE Ant. The cockerel. Seb. Done. The wager? Ant. A laughter. Seb. A match! Adr. Though this island seem to be desert,— Seb. Ha, ha, ha! Antonio! So you're paid. Adr. Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,— Seb. Yet,— Adr. Yet,— Ant. He could not miss ’t. Adr. It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate temperance. Ant, Temperance was a delicate wench. Seb. Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly deliver’d. Adr. The air breathes upon us here most sweetly. Seb. As if it had lungs and rotten ones. Ant. Or as ’twere perfum’d by a fen. Gon. Here is everything advantageous to life. Ant. True; save means to live. Seb. Of that there’s none, or little. Gon. How lush* and lusty the grass looks! How green! Ant. The ground indeed is tawny. Seb. With an eye of green in ’t. Ant. He misses not much. Seb. No; he doth but mistake the truth totally. Gon. But the rarity of it is——-which is indeed almost beyond credit,— Seb. As many vouch’d rarities are. Gon. That our garments, being, as they were, drench’d in the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses, being rather newdy’d than stain’d with salt water. Ant. If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not say he lies? Seb. Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report. Gon. Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the King’s fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis. 3 Temperature. 4Luxuriant.

THE TEMPEST 419 Seb, "Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return. Adr. Tunis was never grac’d before with such a paragon to their queen. Gon. Not since widow Dido’s time. Ant. Widow! a pox o’ that! How came that widow in? Widow Dido! Seb. What if he had said “widower Eneas” too? Good Lord, how you take it! Adr. “Widow Dido” said you? You make me study of that. She was of Carthage, not of Tunis. Gon. This Tunis, sir, was Carthage. Adr, Carthage? Gon. J assure you, Carthage. Ant. His word is more than the miraculous harp. Seb. He hath rais’d the wall and houses too. Ant. What impossible matter will he make easy next? Seb. I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple. Ant. And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands. Gon. Ay. Ant. Why, in good time. . Gon. Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now Queen. Ant. And the rarest that e’er came there. Seb. Bate,’ I beseech you, widow Dido. Ant. O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido. Gon. Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the farst day I wore it? I mean, in a sort. Ant. That sort was well fish’d for. Gon. When I wore it at your daughter’s marriage? Alon. You cram these words into mine ears against The stomach of my sense.’ Would I had never Married my daughter there! for, coming thence, My son is lost and, in my rate,’ she too, 5 Except. §My inclination to hear. 7? Opinion.

420 SHAKESPEARE Who is so far from Italy removed I ne’er again shall see her. O thou mine heir Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish Hath made his meal on thee? Fran. Sir, he may live. I saw him beat the surges under him, And ride upon their backs. He trod the water, Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted The surge most swoln that met him. His bold head *Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke To the shore, that o’er his wave-worn basis bowed, As stooping to relieve him. I not doubt He came alive to land. Alon. No, no, he’s gone. Seb. Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss, That would not bless our Europe with your daughter, But rather lose her to an African; Where she at least is banish’d from your eye, Who hath cause to wet the grief on ’t. Alon. Prithee, peace. Seb. You were kneel’d to and importun’d otherwise By all of us, and the fair soul herself Weigh’d between loathness and obedience, at Which end o’ the beam should bow. We have lost your son, I fear, for ever. Milan and Naples have Moe’* widows in them of this business’ making Than we bring men to comfort them. The fault’s your own. Alon. So is the dear’st o’ the loss. Gon. My lord Sebastian, The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in. You rub the sore, When you should bring the plaster. Seb. Very well. Ant, And most chirurgeonly? 8More. 9% Like a surgeon.

THE TEMPEST 421 Gon. It is foul weather in us all, good sir, When you are cloudy. Seb. Foul weather? Ant. Very foul. Gon. Had I plantation” of this isle, my lord,— Ant. He'd sow ’t with nettle-seed. Seb. Or docks, or mallows. Gon. And were the king on ’t, what would I do? Seb. Scape being drunk for want of wine. Gon. I’ the commonwealth I would by contraries Execute all things; for no kind of traffic Would I admit; no name of magistrate; Letters should not be known; riches, poverty, And use of service, none; contract, succession, Bourn," bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none; No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil; No occupation; ail men idle, all; And women too, but innocent and pure; No sovereignty ;— ; Seb. Yet he would be king on ’t. Ant. 'The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning. Gon. All things in common nature should produce Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony, Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,” Would I not have; but nature should bring forth, Of it own kind, all foison,” all abundance, To feed my innocent people. Seb, No marrying ’mong his subjects? Ant. None, man; all idle; whores and knaves. Gon. I would with such perfection govern, sir, To excel the golden age. Seb. Save his Majesty! Ant.

Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you. So you may continue and laugh at nothing still. Ant. What a blow was there given! Seb. An it had not fallen flatlong.” Gon. You are gentlemen of brave mettle; you would lift the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue in it five weeks without changing. Enter Ante [invisible], playing solemn music Seb. We would so, and then go a bat-fowling. Ant, Nay, good my lord, be not angry. Gon. No, I warrant you; I will not adventure my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep, for I am very heavy? Ant. Go sleep, and hear us. [All sleep except ALon., Ses., and Anr.] Alon. What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts. I find They are inclin’d to do so. Seb. Please you, sir, Do not omit the heavy offer of it. It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth, It is a comforter. Ant. We two, my lord, Will guard your person while you take your rest, And watch your safety. Alon. Thank you. Wondrous heavy. [Atonso sleeps. Exit Artet.] Seb, What a strange drowsiness possesses them! Ant. It is the quality o’ the climate. Seb, Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not Myself dispos’d to sleep. Ant. Nor I; my spirits are nimble. 14On the flat side.

No more:— And yet methinks I see it in thy face, What thou shouldst be. The occasion speaks thee, and My strong imagination sees a crown Dropping upon thy head. Seb. What, art thou waking? Ant. Do you not hear me speak? Seb. I do; and surely It is a sleepy language, and thou speak’st Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say? This is a strange repose, to be asleep With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving, And yet so fast asleep. Ant. Noble Sebastian, Thou let’st thy fortune sleep—die, rather; wink’st Whiles thou art waking. Seb. Thou dost snore distinctly; There’s meaning in thy snores. , Ant. 1 am more serious than my custom; you Must be so too, if heed me; which to do Trebles thee o’er. Seb.

Seb. I have no hope That he’s undrown’d. Ant. O, out of that no hope What great hope have you! No hope that way is Another way so high a hope that even Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond, But doubt discovery there.’* Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drown’d? Seb. He’s gone. Ant. Then, tell me, Who’s the next heir of Naples? Seb. Claribel. Ant. She that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells Ten leagues beyond man’s life; she that from Naples Can have no note, unless the sun were post— The man i’ the moon’s too slow—till new-born chins Be rough and razorable; she that—from whom We all were sea-swallow’d, though some cast again, And by that destiny to perform an act Whereof what’s past is prologue, what to come In yours and my discharge. Seb. What stuff is this! How say you? *Tis true, my brother’s daughter’s Queen of Tunis; So is she heir of Naples; *twixt which regions There is some space. Ant. A space whose every cubit Seems to cry out, “How shall that Claribel 17 As little remembered. | 18 Whether there is anything higher to be seen.

Here lies your brother, No better than the earth he lies upon If he were that which now he’s like, that’s dead; Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it, Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus, To the perpetual wink for aye might put This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who Should not upbraid our course.

Seb, Whiles we stood here securing your repose, Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing Like bulls, or rather lions. Did ’t not wake you? It struck mine ear most terribly. Alon. I heard nothing. Ant. O, ’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear, To make an earthquake! Sure, it was the roar Of a whole herd of lions. Alon. Heard you this, Gonzalo?

THE TEMPEST 427 Gon. Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming, And that a strange one too, which did awake me. I shak’d you, sir, and cried. As mine eyes open’d, I saw their weapons drawn. There was a noise, That’s verily. "Tis best we stand upon our guard, Or that we quit this place. Let’s draw our weapons. Alon, Lead off this ground; and let’s make further search For my poor son.

428 SHAKESPEARE Trin, Here’s neither bush nor shrub, to bear off any weather at all, and another storm brewing; IJ hear it sing i’ the wind. Yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bombard* that would shed his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide my head; yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we here? A man ora fish? Dead or alive? A fish; he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind of not-of-the-newest Poor-John.’ A strange fish! Were I in England now, as once I was, and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver. There would this monster make a man; any strange beast there makes a man. When they will not give a doit’ to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg’d like a man! and his fins like arms! Warm, o’ my troth! I do now let loose my opinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt. [Thunder.] Alas, the storm is come again! My best way is to creep under his gaberdine;’ there is no other shelter hereabout. Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows. I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past. Enter Stepuano, singing |: a bottle in his hand].

Do you put tricks upon ’s with savages and men of Ind, ha? I have not scap’d drowning to be afeard now of your four legs; for it hath been said, “As proper® a man as ever went on four legs’ cannot make him give ground”; and it shall be said so again while Stephano breathes at nostrils. Cal. The spirit torments me! Oh! Ste. This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil should he learn our language? I will give him some relief, if it be but for that. If I can recover him and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he’s a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat’s leather." Cal. Do not torment me, prithee; Ill bring my wood home faster. Ste. He’s in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest. He shall taste of my bottle; if he have never drunk wine afore, it will go near to remove his fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that hath him, and that soundly. Cal. Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I know it by thy trembling. Now Prosper works upon thee. Ste. Come on your ways. Open your mouth; here is that which will give language to you, cat. Open your mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you, and that soundly. You cannot tell who’s your friend. Open your chaps again. Trin. I should know that voice; it should be—but he is drown’d; and these are devils. O defend me! Ste. Four legs and two voices; a most delicate monster! His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I will pour some in thy other mouth. Trin. Stephano] Ste. Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This is a devil, and no monster.

Full many a lady I have ey’d with best regard, and many a time The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage Brought my too diligent ear; for several virtues Have I lik’d several women, never any With so full soul, but some defect in her Did quarrel with the noblest grace she ow’d* And put it to the foil;° but you, O you, So perfect and so peerless, are created Of every creature’s best! 3 Smitten (with love). 4 Visit. 5Qwned. © Marred it. 433

How features are abroad, I am skilless’ of; but, by my modesty, The jewel in my dower, I would not wish Any companion in the world but you, Nor can imagination form a shape, Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle Something too wildly, and my father’s precepts I therein do forget. Fer. I am in my condition A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king; I would, not so!—and would no more endure This wooden* slavery than to suffer The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak. The very instant that I saw you, did My heart fly to your service; there resides, To make me slave to it; and for your sake Am I this patient log-man. Mir. Do you love me? Fer. O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound, And crown what I profess with kind event If I speak true! if hollowly, invert What best is boded me to mischief! I Beyond all limit of what else i’ the world Do love, prize, honour you. Mir. Tam a fool To weep at what I am glad of. Pros. Fair encounter Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace On that which breeds between ’em! Fer. Wherefore weep you? Mir. At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer What I desire to give, and much less take TIgnorant. 8% Of carrying wood.

I am your wife, if you will marry me; If not, I'll die your maid. To be your fellow You may deny me; but I'll be your servant, Whether you will or no. Fer. My mistress, dearest; And I thus humble ever. Mir. My husband, then? Fer. Ay, with a heart as willing As bondage e’er of freedom. Here’s my hand. Mir. And mine, with my heart in ’t. And now farewell Till half an hour hence. Fer. A thousand thousand! Exeunt [Fer. and Mir. severally]. Pros. So glad of this as they I cannot be, Who are surpris’d withal; but my rejoicing At nothing can be more. I’ll to my book, For yet ere supper-time must I perform Much business appertaining. Exit.

Servant-monster, drink to me. Trin. Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They say there’s but five upon this isle: we are three of them; if the other two be brain’d like us, the state totters. Ste. Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee. Thy eyes are almost set in thy head. Trin. Where should they be set else? He were a brave monster indeed, if they were set in his tail. 1 Attack (the bottle). The figure is from naval warfare.

436 SHAKESPEARE Ste. My man-monster hath drown’d his tongue in sack. For my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues off and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my standard? Trin. Your lieutenant, if you list; he’s no standard. Ste. We'll not run, Monsieur Monster. Trin. Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet say nothing neither. Ste. Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a good mooncalf. Cal. How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe. T’ll not serve him; he’s not valiant. Trin. Thou liest, most ignorant monster! I am in case to justle a constable. Why, thou debosh’d® fish, thou, was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a monster? Cal. Lo, how he mocks me! Wilt thou let him, my lord? Trin. “Lord” quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural! Cal. Lo, lo, again! Bite him to death, I prithee. Ste. Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head. If you prove a mutineer,—the next tree! The poor monster’s my subject and he shall not suffer indignity. Cal. I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleas’d to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee? Ste. Marry, will 1; kneel and repeat it. I will stand, and so shall Trinculo. Enter Arter, invisible Cal. As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant a sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island. Ari. Thou liest. Cal. Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou.

THE TEMPEST 437 Trin. Why, I said nothing. Ste. Mum, then, and no more. Proceed. Cal. I say, by sorcery he got this isle; From me he got it. If thy greatness will Revenge it on him,—for I know thou dar’st, But this thing dare not,— Ste. That’s most certain. Cal. Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee. Ste. How now shall this be compass’d? Canst thou bring me to the party? Cal. Yea, yea, my lord. I'll yield him thee asleep, Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head. Ari. Thou liest; thou canst not. Cal. What a pied ninny’s‘ this! Thou scurvy patch!® I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows And take his bottle from him. When that’s gone He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him Where the quick freshes® are. Ste. Trinculo, run into no further danger. Interrupt the monster one word further, and, by this hand, I’ll turn my mercy out o’ doors and make a stock-fish’ of thee. Trin. Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther off. Ste. Didst thou not say he lied? Ari. Thou liest. Ste. Do I so? Take thou that. [Beats Trin. ] As you like this, give me the lie another time. Trin. I did not give the lie. Out o’ your wits and hearing too? A pox o’ your bottle! this can sack and drinking do. A murrain® on your monster, and the devil take your fingers! Cal. Ha, ha, ha! Ste. Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand farther off. Cal, Beat him enough. After a little time Ill beat him too. Ste. Stand farther. Come, proceed. Cal, Why, as I told thee, ’tis a custom with him, I’ the afternoon to sleep.

Remember First to possess his books; for without them He’s but a sot, as I am, nor hath not One spirit to command. They all do hate him As rootedly as I. Burn but his books. He has brave utensils,—for so he calls them,— Which, when he has a house, he’ll deck withal. And that most deeply to consider is The beauty of his daughter. He himself Calls her a nonpareil. I never saw a woman But only Sycorax my dam and she; But she as far surpasseth Sycorax As greatest does least. Ste. Is it so brave a lass? Cal. Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant, And bring thee forth brave brood. Ste. Monster, I will kill this man. His daughter and I will be king and queen,—save our Graces!—and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo? Trin. Excellent. Ste. Give me thy hand. I am sorry I beat thee; but, while thou liv’st, keep a good tongue in thy head. Cal, Within this half hour will he be asleep. Wilt thou destroy him then? Ste. Ay, on mine honour. Ari. This will I tell my master. Cal. Thou mak’st me merry; I am full of pleasure. Let us be jocund. Will you troll the catch" You taught me but while-ere? Ste. At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing. Sings. Flout ’em and scout ’em And scout ’em and flout ’em; Thought is free. 8 Rip up his belly. 1°Windpipe. 1 Part-song.

THE TEMPEST 439 Cal. That’s not the tune. Arte plays the tune on a tabor and pipe. Ste. What is this same? Trin. This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture of Nobody. Ste. If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness. If thou be’st a devil, take ’t as thou list. Trin. O, forgive me my sins! Ste. He that dies pays all debts. I defy thee. Mercy upon us! Cal. Art thou afeard? Ste. No, monster, not I. Cal. Be not afeard. The isle is full of noises, Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not. Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices That, if I then had wak’d after long sleep, Will make me sleep again; and then, in dreaming, The clouds methought would open and show riches Ready to drop upon me, that, when I wak’d, I cried to dream again. Ste. This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have my music for nothing. Cal. When Prospero is destroy’d. Ste. That shall be by and by. I remember the story. Trin. The sound is going away. Let’s follow it, and after do our work. Ste. Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could see this taborer; he lays it on. Trin. Wilt come? I'll follow Stephano. Exeunt.

The King, His brother, and yours, abide all three distracted, And the remainder mourning over them, Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly Him that you term’d, sir, “The good old lord, Gonzalo,” His tears run down his beard, like winter’s drops From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works ’em That if you now beheld them, your affections Would become tender. Pros. Dost thou think so, spirit? Ari. Mine would, sir, were I human. Pros. And mine shall. Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling Of their afflictions, and shall not myself, One of their kind, that relish all as sharply Passion‘ as they, be kindlier mov’d than thou art? Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick. Yet with my nobler reason ’gainst my fury Do I take part. The rarer action is In virtue than in vengeance. They being penitent, The sole drift of my purpose doth extend Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel. My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore, And they shall be themselves. Ari. T'll fetch them, sir. Pros. Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves, And ye that on the sands with printless foot Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him When he comes back; you demi-puppets® that By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make, Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice 3 Protects from the weather. ‘Feel emotion as keenly. 5 Beings half as big as puppets. 453 Exit.

454 SHAKESPEARE To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid, Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm’d The noontide sun, call’d forth the mutinous winds And ’twixt the green sea and the azur’d vault Set roaring war; to the dread rattling thunder Have I given fire, and rifted Jove’s stout oak With his own bolt; the strong-bas’d promontory Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck’d up The pine and cedar; graves at my command Have wak’d their sleepers, op’d, and let ’em forth By my so potent art. But this rough magic I here abjure, and, when I have requir’d Some heavenly music, which even now I do, To work mine end upon their senses that This airy charm is for, I’ll break my staff, Bury it certain fathoms in the earth, And deeper than did ever plummet sound I'll drown my book. Solemn music. Here enters Arte before: then Atonzo, with a frantic gesture, attended by Gonzato; Sepast1an and Antonio in like manner, attended by Avrian and Francisco. They all enter the circle which Prospero had made, and there stand charmed; which Prospero observing, speaks A solemn air and the best comforter To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains, Now useless, boil’d within thy skull! There stand, For you are spell-stopp’d. Holy Gonzalo, honourable man, Mine eyes, even sociable® to the shew of thine, Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace, And as the morning steals upon the night, Melting the darkness, so their rising senses Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle Their clearer reason.

Merrily, merrily shall I live now Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.” Pros. Why, that’s my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee; But yet thou shalt have freedom. So, so, so. To the King’s ship, invisible as thou art; There shalt thou find the mariners asleep Under the hatches. The master and the boatswain Being awake, enforce them to this place, And presently, I prithee.

For more assurance that a living prince Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body; And to thee and thy company I bid A hearty welcome. Alon. Whe’er thou be’st he or no, Or some enchanted trifle to abuse!’ me, As late I have been, I not know. Thy pulse Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee, The affliction of my mind amends, with which I fear, a madness held me. This must crave, An if this be at all, a most strange story, Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero Be living and be here? Pros. First, noble friend, Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot Be measur’d or confin’d. Gon. Whether this be Or be not, I'll not swear. Pros. You do yet taste Some subtleties o’ the isle, that will not let you Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all! [Aside to Ses. and Ant.] But you, my brace of lords, were 1 so minded, I here could pluck his Highness’ frown upon you And justify you traitors. At this time I will tell no tales. Seb. [ Aside.] The devil speaks in him. Pros. No. For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require Il Deceive.

THE TEMPEST My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know, Thou must restore. Alon. If thou be’st Prospero, Give us particulars of thy preservation, How thou hast met us here, whom three hours since Were wreck’d upon this shore, where I have lost — How sharp the point of this remembrance is!— My dear son Ferdinand. Pros. I am woe for ’t, sir. Alon. Irreparable is the loss, and Patience Says it is past her cure. Pros. IT rather think You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace For the like loss I have her sovereign aid And rest myself content. Alon. You the like loss! Pros. As great to me as late; and, supportable To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you, for I Have lost my daughter. Alon. A daughter? O heavens, that they were living both in Naples, The King and Queen there! That they were, I wish Myself were mudded in that oozy bed Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter? Pros. In this last tempest. I perceive, these lords At this encounter do so much admire” That they devour their reason and scarce think Their eyes do offices of truth, their words Are natural breath; but, howsoe’er you have Been justled from your senses, know for certain That I am Prospero and that very duke Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely Upon this shore, where you were wreck’d, was landed, To be the lord on ’t.

Here Prospero discovers FERDINAND and Miranpa playing at chess Mir. Sweet lord, you play me false. Fer. No, my dearest love, I would not for the world. Mir. Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle, And I would call it fair play. Alon. If this prove A vision of the island, one dear son Shall I twice lose. Seb. A most high miracle! Fer, Though the seas threaten, they are merciful; T have curs’d them without cause. [Kneels.] Alon. Now all the blessings Of a glad father compass thee about! Arise, and say how thou cam’st here. Mir. O, wonder! How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world, That has such people in ’t! Pros. *Tis new to thee. Alon, What is this maid with whom thou wast at play? Your eld’st acquaintance cannot be three hours. Is she the goddess that hath sever’d us, And brought us thus together? Fer. Sir, she is mortal, But by immortal Providence she’s mine. I chose her when I could not ask my father For his advice, nor thought I had one. She

THE TEMPEST 459 Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan, Of whom so often I have heard renown, But never saw before; of whom I have Receiv’d a second life; and second father This lady makes him to me. Alon. I am hers, But, O, how oddly will it sound that I Must ask my child forgiveness! Pros. There, sir, stop. Let us not burden our remembrances with A heaviness that’s gone. Gon. I have inly wept, Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods, And on this couple drop a blessed crown! For it is you that have chalk’d forth the way Which brought us hither. Alon. I say, Amen, Gonzalo! Gon. Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue Should become Kings of Naples? O, rejoice Beyond a common joy, and set it down With gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage Did Claribel her husband find a Tunis, And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom In a poor isle, and all of us ourselves When no man was his own. Alon. [To Fer. and Mir.] Give me your hands, Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart That doth not wish you joy! Gon. Be it so! Amen!

The best news is, that we have safely found Our king and company; the next, our ship— Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split— Is tight and yare“ and bravely rigg’d as when We first put out to sea.

Say, how came you hither? Boats. If I did think, sir, I were well awake, I'd strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep, And—how we know not—all clapp’d under hatches; Where but even now with strange and several noises Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains. And moe diversity of sounds, all horrible, We were awak’d; straightway, at liberty; Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld Our royal, good, and gallant ship, our master Cap’ring to eye” her. On a trice, so please you, Even in a dream, were we divided from them And were brought moping” hither. Ari. [Aside to Pros.]| Was ’t well done? Pros. { Aside to Art.] Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free. Alon, This is as strange a maze as e’er men trod; And there is in this business more than nature Was ever conduct of. Some oracle Must rectify our knowledge. Pros. Sir, my liege, Do not infest” your mind with beating on The strangeness of this business. At pick’d leisure, Which shall be shortly, single’ Pll resolve you, Which to you shall seem probable, of every These happen’d accidents; till when, be cheerful And think of each thing well.

Coragio, bully-monster, coragio! Trin. If these be true spies which I wear in my head, here’s a goodly sight. Cal. O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed! How fine my master is!

Cal. I shall be pinch’d to death. Alon. Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler? Seb. He is drunk now. Where had he wine? Alon. And Trinculo is reeling ripe.

As you look To have my pardon, trim it handsomely. Cal. Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass Was I, to take this drunkard for a god And worship this dull fool! Pros. Go to; away! Alon. Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it. Seb. Or stole it, rather.

Sir, 1 invite your Highness and your train To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it Go quick away,—the story of my life And the particular accidents gone by Since I came to this isle. An in the morn I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples, Where I have hope to see the nuptial Of these our dear-belov’d solemnized; And thence retire me to my Milan, where Every third thought shall be my grave. Alon. I long To hear the story of your life, which must Take the ear strangely. Pros. Ill deliver all; And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales, And sail so expeditious that shall catch Your royal fleet far off. [Aside to Art.] My Ariel, chick,

EPILOGUE SPOKEN BY PRosPERO Now my charms are all o’erthrown, And what strength I have’s mine own, Which is most faint. Now, ’tis true, I must be here confin’d by you, Or sent to Naples. Let me not, Since I have my dukedom got And pardon’d the deceiver, dwell In this bare island by your spell; But release me from my bands With the help of your good hands. Gentle breath of yours my sails Must fill, or else my project fails, Which was to please. Now I want Spirits to enforce, art to enchant, And my ending is despair, Unless I be reliev’d by prayer, Which pierces so that it assaults Mercy itself and frees all faults. As you from crimes would pardon’d be, Let your indulgence set me free. Exit.
